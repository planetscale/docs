## How to

### Add a new document

- All pages in the documentation are markdown (.mdx) files with a frontmatter block on the top. The frontmatter block defines the title and (optionally) a subtitle and/or banner for the page.
- When creating a new document, also create a corresponding entry in `meta.json` to define the category and position of the document's link in the navigation list.

## Notes

- Search is powered by [DocSearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com/). The PlanetScale configuration on DocSearch can be viewed [here](https://github.com/algolia/docsearch-configs/blob/master/configs/planetscale.json)
- Sitemap is only generated during a build and is not checked in to the repo.
