PlanetScale can push metrics to Datadog to assist your team with understanding your database usage and performance.

### Prerequisites

- A [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) account

## Configuring the Datadog integration

1. In Datadog, install the [PlanetScale integration](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#integrations/planetscale).
2. Create a Datadog API key in your [Datadog Organization Settings](https://app.datadoghq.com/organization-settings/api-keys) and copy the key.
3. In PlanetScale, go to your organization's [Integrations settings](https://app.planetscale.com/settings/integrations), and select **Configure** for the Datadog integration. Paste your Datadog API key into the field.

Once complete, a "PlanetScale" dashboard will be available with incoming metrics from PlanetScale.
