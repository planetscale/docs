## Overview
At PlanetScale, we are committed to delivering a powerful and easy-to-use database platform, while keeping your data secure and compliant. We take security very seriously and we are working hard to ensure the continuous security and integrity of data stored on our platform.

## SOC2 Certification
PlanetScale is currently pursuing _SOC2 compliance_. We have implemented all relevant SOC2 controls, and can provide un-audited reporting with attestation from our auditor upon request. 

<InfoBlock type="note">
We plan to have a SOC2 Type II report in July, 2021.

## Encryption at Rest
All data is stored encrypted at rest throughout the PlanetScale platform. This helps mitigate the risk of unintentional or malicious access to user data on storage systems.

## Access and Management 
We provide configurable authentication, audit logging, and user access management.
