## Organization access control

When you set up your PlanetScale account, you're asked to create an **Organization**.

An organization is essentially a container for your databases, settings, and members. You can create multiple organizations in the same account for different applications or use cases.

Within each organization, you can add members and assign them different roles. This document covers the different roles, the ways you can assign roles, permissions associated with those roles.

## Roles and permissions

We currently support three different roles in your organization:

- `Organization Administrator`
- `Organization Member`
- `Database Administrator`

### Organization Administrator

An `Organization Administrator` can perform all actions in an organization, as well as all actions on _every_ database within that organization.

### Organization Member

An `Organization Member` can only perform limited actions within an organization and on all databases in that organization.

### Database Administrator

A `Database Administrator` can perform all actions on the database for which they were assigned the `Databases Administrator` role.

This role is assigned at the **database level** and therefore **does not** have any organization-level permissions. If you want to [grant a member _full_ access to manage one or several databases](#assign-roles-at-a-database-level) but not the organization, then this is the role you want.

## Organization-level permissions

Each role has a set of permissions assigned to it, which determines what actions that role is allowed to take within an organization or database.

The following table describes permissions assigned at the organization level for `Organization Administrators` and `Organization Members`. Because `Database Administrators` don't have any organization-level permissions, they are not included in this table.

## Database-level permissions

The following table describes the permissions assigned at the **database level** for `Organization Administrators`, `Organization Members`, and `Database Administrators`.

For `Organization Administrators` and `Organization Members`, these permissions apply to every database in the organization. Because the `Database Administrator` role is assigned at the database level, the permissions are for the specific database(s) for which they have the `Database Administrator` role.

An organization may have several databases, and an `Organization Member` may have different access to each database depending on whether or not they also have the `Database Administrator` role.

## Assign organization roles to members

You can follow the steps below to assign roles to your members. You must be an Organization Administrator to modify member roles.

- In the [PlanetScale dashboard](https://app.planetscale.com/), click on the Settings tab in the top navigation.
- Click on "Members" in the sidebar on the left.
- From here, you can click on the dropdown on the right under the "Role" column to select the role you want to apply to each member.

You can also invite new members to your organization and assign roles once they accept their invitation. New members will be added with the [`Organization Member`](#organization-member) role by default.

<InfoBlock type='note'>
  Member role management is issued at the organization level. Each organization in your account may have different
  members with different access levels.
</InfoBlock>

## Assign roles at a database level

There  are two ways to assign database-level roles to Organization members:

1. Individually using the `Database Administrator` role.
2. Creating a Team, adding member(s), and adding database(s) to that team.

### Individually assign the `Database Administrator` role
To assign a member the role of `Database Administrator`, follow the steps outlined below. You must be an Organization Administrator or an existing Database Administrator to manage the `Database Administrator` role.

<InfoBlock type='note'>
  Members that create a database are automatically assigned the role of `Database Administrator` for that database.
</InfoBlock>

1. In the [PlanetScale dashboard](https://app.planetscale.com/), click on the name of the database you want to add a Database Administrator to.
2. Click on the "**Settings**" tab in the top navigation.
3. Click on "**Administrators**" in the sidebar on the left.
4. To add an administrator, click on the "**Add administrator**" button and select the member you wish to add as a Database Administrator.
5. From here, you can also remove a Database Administrator by clicking the "**Remove**" button next to their name.

### Add Database Administrator role via Teams

If you wish to give several members the Database Administrator role, you may want to [create a Team](/docs/concepts/teams#create-and-manage-teams). This will allow you to manage the access to that database all in one place.

For instructions, see our [Teams documentation](/docs/concepts/teams).
