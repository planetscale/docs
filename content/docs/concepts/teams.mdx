## Overview

PlanetScale allows you to create teams within organizations. This allows you to easily manage administrator access to one or multiple databases all in one spot.

## Create and manage Teams

You can manage teams straight from your PlanetScale dashboard by going to "**Settings**" > "**Teams**".

<InfoBlock type='note'>
  Only <a href="/docs/concepts/access-control#organization-administrator">Organization Administrators</a> can create and manage Teams.
</InfoBlock>

Once you add databases to a team, any members on that team will have [Database Administrator access](/docs/concepts/access-control#database-level-permissions) to those databases. Review our [Access control documentation](/docs/concepts/access-control) to understand the full scope of Database Administrator access.

### Create a team
1. On your PlanetScale overview page, click "**Settings**".
2. Click "**Teams**" in the left nav.

3. Give your team a name and description (*optional*).
4. Click "**Create team**".

### Add members

1. Click "**Add a member**".
2. You'll see a list of your Organization members. Select the member(s) one at a time that you wish to add to the team.

### Add databases

1. Click "**Add databases**".
2. Select the databases you want this team to have [database administrator access](/docs/concepts/access-control#database-level-permissions) to.

Now, when you go to the Settings page for any databases you've added to a team, you'll also be able to view and revoke access straight from the database Administrators page.

### Remove members and databases

To remove a member from a team, find their name in the member list and click "**Remove**". At this time, you'll also be able to delete any passwords this member has created to ensure you've completely revoked their access to the database.

To remove a database from a team, click the "**x**" next to the database name under "Administrator permissions". This will remove database administrator access for all members of the team.

## Directory Sync with Teams

If you have [SSO with Directory Sync](/docs/concepts/sso#directory-sync) enabled, all Teams will be managed by your Directory Sync directory. You can add and remove database access to teams, but member management must be done through your directory.
