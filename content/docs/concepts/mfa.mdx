## Overview

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) provides better safety for your databases and prevents unauthorized access to your user account. MFA strengthens security by requiring two or more methods _(i.e. authentication factors)_ to verify your identity.

PlanetScale allows users logging in with an email address and password to set MFA as a requirement for logging into the user account.

  If you're authenticating via GitHub OAuth or{' '}

  not be displayed.

### Authentication providers

PlanetScale supports login with a unique _time-based one-time password (TOTP)_ that is generated for your user account by using TOTP apps such as [1Password](https://support.1password.com/one-time-passwords/), [Authy](https://support.authy.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006303934-Add-a-New-Two-Factor-Authentication-2FA-Account-Token-in-the-Authy-App), or [LastPass Authenticator](https://lastpass.com/auth/).

## Enable MFA

You can enable MFA for your user account under your PlanetScale account settings.

1. Go to your [PlanetScale account settings](https://app.planetscale.com/account) page.

2. Find the **Security** row and click the **"Setup multi-factor authentication"** button.

This will bring up a pop-up modal with a _QR code_ and some `recovery codes` that you will need to copy.

3. Scan the QR Code with your preferred TOTP app and enter the generated code.

4. Press **"Validate OTP"** to ensure that your application setup is correct.

5. Once the generated code is validated, click the **Copy** button in the `recovery codes` section.

<InfoBlock type="tip">
  Recovery codes are only visible during the MFA setup process. Make sure the
  recovery codes are copied and saved some place secure before continuing.
</InfoBlock>

6. Click **Done** to close the pop-up modal.

## Login with two-factor authentication

Once you've enabled MFA in your PlanetScale user account, the next time you login, you'll be prompted to enter your two-factor authentication (2FA) code.

- Use the **OTP code** generated by your preferred TOTP app to login to your PlanetScale account.

## Recovery code login

The `recovery codes` shown during the MFA setup are crucial to regain access to your account, in the event that you lose the device that you used to setup your TOTP application and create authentication codes.

You can use one of the `recovery codes` in the place of a TOTP token in the second screen during login.

## Disable MFA

<InfoBlock type="warning">
  <div>
    We strongly recommend that you do not disable MFA to avoid unauthorized
    access to your user account.

<InfoBlock type="note">
  <div>
    <b>Effects of disabling MFA:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Any devices setup with the QR code for your account will no longer be
        able to produce valid OTP tokens.
      </li>
      <li>
        Any recovery codes that were generated when MFA was enabled will no
        longer be valid.
