## Overview

The organization audit log grants [Organization Administrators](/concepts/access-control#organization-administrator) access to review **actions** performed by individual members of the organization. In addition, each audit log includes **events** detailing who performed the **action** and when it happened.

On the [Scaler plan](https://docs.planetscale.com/concepts/billing#planetscale-plans), audit log events are retained for 15 days in your PlanetScale account. On the free Developer plan, audit logs are retained for 5 days.

## Review your organization audit log

You can review your organization audit log under your PlanetScale **organization** settings: `app.planetscale.com/<org>/settings/audit-log`.

Once there, you can filter the audit log by **Actor** and/or **Action**.

Clicking and expanding individual log **event** names empowers you to investigate additional metadata that can provide broader context around what changed.
