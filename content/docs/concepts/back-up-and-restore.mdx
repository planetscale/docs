## Overview

PlanetScale provides the ability to create, schedule, and restore backups for production and development database branches.

<InfoBlock type="note">
  Daily backups of database branches are included free of charge for all databases. Our <a href="https://docs.planetscale.com/concepts/billing#planetscale-plans">Scaler plan</a> includes automated backups every 12 hours.

## View backups

To view backups for either `main` or your _development_ branches, go to your branch backups page: `app.planetscale.com/<org>/<database>/<branch>/backups`.

Once there, you'll find additional details about your backup history.

## Create manual backups

In addition to the daily default backups that PlanetScale schedules for your database branches, you can create additional **manual** backups.

To create a manual backup, follow the steps outlined below:

1. Go to your branch backups page: `app.planetscale.com/<org>/<database>/<branch>/backups`.

2. Click the **Create manual backup** button.

This will bring up a pop-up modal that prompts you to _name_ your **backup** and select how long you wish to keep the backup.

3. Click the **Backup up now** button to finish the backup and close the pop-up modal.

## Schedule backups

You can add additional **scheduled backups** for both your `main` and _development_ branches, billed at $0.023 per GB per month.

1. Go to your database backups settings page: `app.planetscale.com/<org>/<database>/settings/backups`.

2. Click the **New schedule** button.

This will bring up a pop-up modal that prompts you to configure backup frequency, select how long you wish to keep the backup, and to _name_ your **schedule**.
