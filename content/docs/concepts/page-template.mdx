## Single-line code block

A single-line code block is defined as below. For proper language formatting, providing the language type is necessary.

```

```

## Multi-line code block

Multi-line code blocks are defined with the same syntax as single-line code blocks.

```

## Split cmd+output code blocks

Code blocks can also be configured to have a split view of a command and corresponding output by delimiting the two pieces with a `------` string. In such a case, the copy button will only copy the command and not the output.

```
$mysql --host {hostname} --port {port number} -p --user {username}
------

## Tables

Tables use the default markdown syntax. [tablegenerator.com](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) is a nifty little tool to visually create such tables.

| Column Name | Column Mane | Column Noon | Column Moon |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Data        | Data        | Data        | Data        |
| Bass        | Base        | Bias        | Blaze       |

## Theme sensitive images

Images benefit from a brief description which also serves as the `ALT` tag value (will be made independently configurable later). Theme sensitive images should be added in doubles; one with a `_light` suffix and with `_dark`. The image with the `_light` suffix should be the one that is linked within the markdown. The system will use the `dark` mode image appropriately.

## Theme agnostic images

Images can also be added to be theme agnostic i.e. they will not change in anyway regardless of page's theme. These images don't have a special suffix format.

## Info blocks

Info blocks come in three flavors: `note`, `warning`, and `tip`.

<InfoBlock type='note'>
  This is an info callout with some more text thrown in to simulate a multi-line rendering. And an extra sentence for
  some density.
</InfoBlock>

<InfoBlock type='warning'>This is a warning callout.</InfoBlock>

<InfoBlock type='tip'>This is a tip callout.</InfoBlock>

<NextBlock
  steps={[
    {
      text: 'Learn more about page in category 2',
      link: '/category-2/page-in-category-2'
    },
    {
      text: 'Learn more about page in category 3',
      link: '/category-3/page-in-category-3'
    }
  ]}
></NextBlock>
