subtitle: 'Selecting a region during database and branch creation.'

## Overview

PlanetScale currently offers database deployment in multiple regions. Select the region closest to your application servers to reduce latency between your database and application. Deploy development branches in the region closest to your own location to reduce latency when working with the branch.

A number of resources exist to help find which region has the lowest latency from your location – such as [CloudPing](https://www.cloudping.co/grid#).

## Available regions

Currently, the following regions are supported, with their respective slugs:

- US East - Northern Virginia `us-east`
- US West - Oregon `us-west`
- EU West - Dublin `eu-west`
- Asia Pacific - Mumbai `ap-south`
- Asia Pacific - Singapore `ap-southeast`
- Asia Pacific - Tokyo `ap-northeast`

## Selecting the database region

PlanetScale allows you to select the region for the main branch of your database during database creation. By default, all database branches created within this database will also be created in this region.

You can also select the region while creating a database via the CLI by using
the `--region` flag with the region's slug.

  If you do not select a region during database creation using the CLI, it will
  be set to US East.
</InfoBlock>{' '}

Here's an example command for creating a database with a different region:

```shell
pscale database create my-production-database --region us-west
```

## Selecting the branch region

PlanetScale allows you to select a region for development branches during
creation as well. By default, it is set to the same region as its database.

You can also select the region while creating a branch via the CLI by using the
`--region` flag with the region's slug.

Here's an example command for creating a branch with a different region:

```shell
pscale branch create my-production-database add-tables --region eu-west
```

## Restricting the branch regions

[Organization Administrators](/concepts/access-control#organization-administrator) can restrict branches to only being created in the same region as the one selected during database creation. To enable this setting, check the _Restrict region_ setting in the settings page for the database: `app.planetscale.com/<org>/<database>/settings`.
