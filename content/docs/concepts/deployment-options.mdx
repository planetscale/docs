## Overview

PlanetScale offers three different deployment options to suit your application and business needs.

## Cloud

Cloud is the default deployment option. When you sign up for a PlanetScale account, whether on a Hobby, Scaler, or Team plan, your databases will be created on our Cloud deployment offering.

### Cloud highlights

- Your database runs on PlanetScale's [secure](/docs/concepts/security) cloud infrastructure
- Shared infrastructure amongst other PlanetScale customers, often referred to as "multi-tenancy"
- Lowest cost plan
- Option to upgrade default resources
- No configuration requirements on your end

## Managed Cloud

For companies that need their PlanetScale databases hosted in an isolated  AWS or GCP account that **they own themselves**, we also offer a Managed Cloud deployment option.

<InfoBlock type='note'>
  The Managed Cloud offering is only available on our [Enterprise plan](/docs/concepts/billing#planet-scale-plans). If you're interested, please [reach out](https://planetscale.com/contact) and we can figure out a custom solution for your use case.

### Managed Cloud highlights

- Your database runs in a separate AWS or GCP account that you own and PlanetScale manages
- We offer private database connectivity via:
  - **AWS** &mdash; [AWS PrivateLink](https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/) (recommended) or [VPC Peering](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/what-is-vpc-peering.html)
  - **GCP** &mdash; [Private Service Connect](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/private-access-options)
- You can continue to use the PlanetScale UI and CLI in the same way that you would our general cloud offering, but the infrastructure will run on an account owned by you
- Your databases can be deployed to any cloud provider region you choose that offers three Availability Zones, even regions that Cloud does not offer

## Single-tenant Cloud

For companies that need their PlanetScale databases hosted in an isolated AWS or GCP account, but don't want to create their own account, we offer the Single-tenant Cloud option.

<InfoBlock type='note'>
  The Single-tenant Cloud offering is only available on our [Enterprise plan](/docs/concepts/billing#planet-scale-plans). If you're interested, please [reach out](https://planetscale.com/contact) and we can figure out a custom solution for your use case.

### Single-tenant Cloud highlights

- We create and manage an AWS or GCP account for you
- Your resources run on this separate account, apart from other customers, using PlanetScale infrastructure, often referred to as "single-tenancy"
- Your databases can be deployed to any cloud provider region you choose that offers three Availability Zones, even regions that Cloud does not offer
