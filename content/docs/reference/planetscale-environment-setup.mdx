## Setup overview

To interact with PlanetScale and manage your databases, you can use the `pscale` CLI to do the following:

- Create, delete and list your databases and branches
- Open a secure MySQL shell instance
- Manage your deploy requests
- ...and more!

<InfoBlock type='note'>
  <inlineCode>pscale</inlineCode> can use the MySQL command-line client to quickly open an interactive shell for a

### macOS instructions

To install the PlanetScale CLI on macOS, we recommend using Homebrew.

How to install or verify Homebrew is on your computer:

1. Open Terminal.
2. Check if you have Homebrew installed by running the following command:

```
brew -v
```

3. If you don't see "Homebrew" and a version number, then download and [install Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
4. Once you've installed Homebrew, repeat _Step 2_ to verify.

**Installing via Homebrew**

- Run the following command:

```
brew install planetscale/tap/pscale
```

- To install the MySQL command-line client:

```
brew install mysql-client
```

### Linux instructions

`pscale` is available as downloadable binaries from the [releases](https://github.com/planetscale/cli/releases/latest) page.

Download the .deb or .rpm from the [releases](https://github.com/planetscale/cli/releases/latest) page and install with `sudo dpkg -i` and `sudo rpm -i` respectively.

The MySQL command-line client can be installed via your package manager.

- Debian-based distributions:

```
sudo apt-get install mysql-client
```

- RPM-based distributions:

```
sudo yum install community-mysql
```

**Manually**

Download the pre-compiled binaries from the [releases](https://github.com/planetscale/cli/releases/latest) page and copy to the desired location.

Instructions for installing the MySQL client on other Linux distributions can be found in the [official documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/linux-installation.html).

### Windows instructions

On Windows, `pscale` is available via [scoop](https://scoop.sh/), and as a downloadable binary from the [releases](https://github.com/planetscale/cli/releases/latest) page:

```
scoop bucket add pscale https://github.com/planetscale/scoop-bucket.git
scoop install pscale
```

To upgrade to the latest version:

```
scoop update pscale
```

**Installation via binary**
Download the latest [Windows release](https://github.com/planetscale/cli/releases/latest) and unzip the `pscale.exe` file into the folder of your choice. Then, run it from PowerShell or whatever terminal you regularly use.

The MySQL command-line client is available in the [Windows MySQL Installer](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/windows-installation.html). To launch `pscale shell` you will need to have the `mysql.exe` executable's directory in your shell's PATH.

In PowerShell, add that directory to your current shell's PATH:

```powershell
$env:path += ";C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin"
```
