## Setup Overview
PlanetScale is more than a database and our CLI is more than a jumble of commands. It's a command center.

To interact with PlanetScale and manage your databases, you can use the `pscale` CLI to do the following:
- Create, delete and list your Databases and Branches
- Open a secure MySQL shell instance
- Manage your deploy requests
- ...and more!

### Mac instructions
To install the PlanetScale CLI on a Mac, we recommend using Homebrew. 

How to install or verify Homebrew is on your computer:
1. Open your Terminal.
2. Check if you have Homebrew installed by running the following command: 
```zsh
brew -v
```
3. If you don't see "Homebrew" and a version number, then download and [install Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). 
4. Once you've installed Homebrew, repeat _Step 2_ to verify.

**Installing via Homebrew Tap**
- Run the following command:
```zsh
brew install planetscale/tap/pscale
```

- Upgrade to the latest version:
```zsh
brew up
```

### Linux instructions

`pscale` is available as downloadable binaries from the [releases](https://github.com/planetscale/cli/releases/latest) page.

Download the .deb or .rpm from the [releases](https://github.com/planetscale/cli/releases/latest) page and install with `sudo dpkg -i` and `sudo rpm -i` respectively.

**Manually**

Download the pre-compiled binaries from the [releases](https://github.com/planetscale/cli/releases/latest) page and copy to the desired location. 

### Windows instructions

`pscale` is available as downloadable binary from the [releases](https://github.com/planetscale/cli/releases/latest) page. Download this and unzip the `pscale.exe` file into the folder of your choice. Then, run it from `cmd.exe` or whatever terminal you regularly use.
