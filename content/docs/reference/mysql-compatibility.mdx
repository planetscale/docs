subtitle: 'Learn what MySQL syntax, functions, and more are supported by PlanetScale'
---

## Overview

PlanetScale is built on top of open-source Vitess, a database clustering system for horizontal scaling of MySQL. Consequently, PlanetScale is only compatible with MySQL databases.

If you're [importing an existing database](/concepts/database-imports), PlanetScale supports MySQL database versions `5.7` through `8.0`.

New PlanetScale databases are created on MySQL 8 with character set `utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci`. PlanetScale only supports `utf8`, `utf8mb4`, and `utf8mb3` character sets.

## MySQL compatibility limitations

The following reference guide will cover some MySQL syntax, features, and more that PlanetScale either does not support or has limitations around.

If you're attempting to import a database using our Import tool, there are some additional requirements that you can find in our [Database imports documentation](/concepts/database-imports#import-limitations).

### Queries, functions, syntax, and data types

| Statement     | Support | Description |
| ------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `CONSTRAINT...FOREIGN KEY` | ✖️ | The usage of foreign key constraints or `FOREIGN KEY` syntax is [not supported on PlanetScale](/learn/operating-without-foreign-key-constraints). | 
| `ALTER TABLE...RENAME COLUMN` | ✖️ | Renaming columns and tables may be destructive. See our [guide for column rename recommendations](/learn/handling-table-and-column-renames).    |
| `CREATE DATABASE` | ✖️ | You cannot `CREATE` a PlanetScale database from the MySQL command line, however, this is supported in the [PlanetScale CLI](/reference/database). | 
| `DROP DATABASE` | ✖️ | You cannot `DROP` a PlanetScale database from the MYSQL command line, however, this is supported in the [PlanetScale CLI](/reference/database). |
| `PROCEDURE` | ✖️ | We do not support any form of [stored routines](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/stored-routines.html). |
| `FUNCTION` | ✖️ | We do not support any form of [stored routines](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/stored-routines.html). |
| `TRIGGER` | ✖️ | We do not support any form of [stored routines](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/stored-routines.html). |
| `EVENT` | ✖️ | We do not support any form of [stored routines](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/stored-routines.html). |
| `LOAD DATA INFILE` | ✖️ | Loading data via [`LOAD DATA INFILE` is not supported](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/2976). |
| `KILL` | ✖️ | We do not support killing queries or shards from the command line. |

## Miscellaneous

| Action     | Support | Description |
| ------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Empty schemas** | ✖️ | Databases with empty schemas are invalid. You cannot deploy a schema change to production if no tables exist. |
| **Non-InnoDB Storage engine** | ❌ | We only support [InnoDB](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-storage-engine.html) storage engine. |
| **No unique key** | ❌ | We require all tables have a [unique, non-null key](/learn/change-single-unique-key) that remains unchanged during migrations. |
| **Direct DDL** | ✖️ | We do [not allow Direct DDL](https://docs.planetscale.com/learn/how-online-schema-change-tools-work) on [production branches](/concepts/branching). |
| **Disabled binary logs** | ❗ | You must have binary logs enabled if importing a database using our [database importer tool](/concepts/database-imports). See our [Import doc](/concepts/database-imports#server-configuration-issues) for more required configuration. |
