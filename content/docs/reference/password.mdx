## Getting Started

Make sure to first [set up your PlanetScale developer environment](/concepts/planetscale-environment-setup). Once you've installed the `pscale` CLI, you can interact with PlanetScale and manage your databases straight from the command line.

## The `password` command

This command allows you to create, list, and delete branch passwords/credentials.

**Usage:**

```bash
pscale password <SUB-COMMAND> <FLAG>
```

### Available sub-commands

| **Sub-command** | **Sub-command flags** | **Description**        |
| -------- | -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `create <DATABASE_NAME> <BRANCH_NAME> <PASSWORD_ID>` |  | Create new credentials to access a branch's data |
| `delete <DATABASE_NAME> <BRANCH_NAME> <PASSWORD_ID>` | `--force` | Delete the specified branch credentials |
| `list <DATABASE_NAME> <BRANCH_NAME>` | `--web` | List all credentials of a database |

The value `<PASSWORD_ID>` represents the ID number of the set of credentials. To find all available credentials and their IDs, run `pscale list <DATABASE_NAME> <BRANCH_NAME>`.
