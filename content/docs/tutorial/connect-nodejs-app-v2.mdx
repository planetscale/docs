## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll create a simple Node.js and Express.js application and connect it to a PlanetScale database.

## Prerequisites

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
- Install the [PlanetScale CLI](https://github.com/planetscale/cli).
- Authenticate the CLI with the following command:


```zsh
pscale auth login
```

## Set up the example Node.js app

1. Create a new database with the following command:

```zsh
pscale database create my-app
```

2. Clone this repository:

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/planetscale/express-example.git
```

3. Run `cd express-example`.

4. Run `npm install`.

## Connect to PlanetScale with Express.js

### Using pscale connect
1. Use `pscale` to create a connection to your database and start the app with the following command:

```zsh
pscale connect your-db-name main --execute 'node app.js'
```

<InfoBlock type="tip">
  Running pscale connect with the execute flag will pass a DATABASE_URL to the
  node application, enabling it to connect to PlanetScale. Don't forget to look
  in app.js to see how the DATABASE_URL is used.
</InfoBlock>

Congratulations! You successfully connected your Node.js and Express.js application to a PlanetScale database.

### Using a connection string.

You can also create passwords in the PlanetScale UI as documented [here](/concepts/connection-strings#creating-a-password).

#### Using the CLI to create a connection string
1. Using the `pscale` CLI, create a new password for the `main` branch of your database:

```zsh
pscale password create your-db-name main production-password
```
2. Take note of the values it returns to you.

``` bash
Password production-password was successfully created.
Please save the values below as they will not be shown again

  NAME                  USERNAME       ACCESS HOST URL                     ROLE               PLAIN TEXT
 --------------------- -------------- ----------------------------------- ------------------ -------------------------------------------------------
  production-password   jp71f987awnod   gxvhbzcxfw01.us-east-2.psdb.cloud   Can Read & Write   pscale_pw_sVkiE_mtfxQirc4qGZXMf098as90d8as0d98asd
```

3. Create your `DatabaseURL` in the following format : 
```
"mysql://<USERNAME>:<PLAIN TEXT PASSWORD>@<ACCESS HOST URL>/<your-db-name>?sslmode=require"
```

4. Run your application with your DATABASE_URL

``` bash
DATABASE_URL=<VALUE FROM STEP 3> node app.js
```
## Summary

In this tutorial, we created a simple Node.js and Express.js application and connected it to PlanetScale's database and branching environments.

## What's next?

Now that you've successfully connected your Node.js app to PlanetScale, it's time to make schema changes to your tables and [deploy your application with a PlanetScale database to Heroku](/tutorial/deploy-to-heroku)! Learn more about how PlanetScale allows you to make [non-blocking schema changes](/concepts/nonblocking-schema-changes) to your database tables without locking or causing downtime for production databases.
