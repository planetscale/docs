subtitle: ""

## Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll create a simple Node.js and Express.js application and connect it to a PlanetScale database. 

## Prerequisites
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
- Install the [PlanetScale CLI](https://github.com/planetscale/cli).
- Authenticate the CLI with the following command: 
```bash
pscale auth login 
```

### Set up the example Node.js app
1. Create a new database with the following command: 
```bash
pscale database create my-app
```

2. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/planetscale/express-example.git
```
3. Run `cd express-example`

3. Run `npm install`

### Connect to PlanetScale with Express.js

1. Use `pscale` to create a connection to your database and start the app with the following command: 
```bash
pscale connect your-db-name main --execute 'node app.js'
```

<InfoBlock type="tip">
Tip: Running pscale connect with the execute flag will pass a DATABASE_URL to the node application, enabling it to connect to PlanetScale. Don't forget to look in app.js to see how the DATABASE_URL is used.
</InfoBlock>

Congratulations! You successfully connected your Node.js and Express.js application to a PlanetScale database.  

### Summary
In this tutorial, we created a simple Node.js and Express.js application and connected it to PlanetScale's database and branching environments. 

### What's next?
Now that you've successfully connected your Node.js app to PlanetScale, it's time to make schema changes to your tables and [deploy your application](https://github.com/planetscale/express-example#deploying-to-heroku)! Learn more about how PlanetScale allows you to make [non-blocking schema changes](/concepts/nonblocking-schema-changes) to your database tables without locking or causing downtime for production databases.
