## Introduction
In this tutorial, we're going to deploy an application with a PlanetScale database to Heroku. If you already have an application running locally, you can use it for this tutorial.

## Prerequisites
- Install the [PlanetScale CLI](https://github.com/planetscale/cli).
- Authenticate the CLI with the following command:
```zsh
pscale auth login
```
- Setup your application to connect to MySQL using the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.

## Deploy to Heroku
Let's use the `pscale` CLI on Heroku to establish a secure connection to your database.

1. Create a PlanetScale service token:

```zsh
pscale service-token create
```

Take note of the service token **name** and **value** it returns to you.

2. Grant that token access to your database:

```zsh
pscale service-token add-access your-token-name connect_production_branch --database your-db-name
```

3. Set config vars for your Heroku application:
<br>**Updated Terms of Service for Heroku** as of 06/22/2021 <br> See Heroku: [Updated Terms of Service](https://dashboard.heroku.com/terms-of-service)
<br>*required flag:* [[-a], [--app] APP]  *app to run command against*

```
heroku config:set PLANETSCALE_ORG=your-org-name --app <MY-APP> 
heroku config:set PLANETSCALE_SERVICE_TOKEN_NAME=your-token-name --app <MY-APP>
heroku config:set PLANETSCALE_SERVICE_TOKEN=your-token-value --app <MY-APP>
```

<InfoBlock type="note">
  A Note: You'll use your <em>service token</em> to authenticate to your
  database.
</InfoBlock>

4. Add the PlanetScale buildpack to your Heroku application:

```
heroku buildpacks:add https://github.com/planetscale/heroku-buildpack-planetscale
```

This command will install the latest `pscale` CLI into your Heroku application. You can specify a CLI version by setting `PLANETSCALE_CLI_VERSION`

  Tip: Find the latest <a href="https://github.com/planetscale/cli/releases">CLI releases here</a>.
</InfoBlock>

5. Add a `Procfile` that initiates your application using pscale:
```
web: pscale connect your-db-name main --execute 'node app.js'
```

<InfoBlock type="tip">
  Tip: Heroku runs this command when starting the app.
</InfoBlock>

As you can see, we chose to use the sample Node.js and Express.js application we built in our previous [Connect Node.js App](connect-nodejs-app) tutorial.

6. Push to Heroku and you'll have a working app.

Congratulations! You successfully deployed an application to Heroku.

## Summary
In this tutorial, we deployed an application that was connected to a PlanetScale database to Heroku. We chose to use the sample Node.js and Express.js application we built in our previous [Connect Node.js App](connect-nodejs-app) tutorial. That said, you could use any local application you've made and use it to connect to a PlanetScale database.

## What's next?
Now that you've successfully deployed an application to Heroku, it's time to make more schema changes to your tables! Learn more about how PlanetScale allows you to make [non-blocking schema changes](/concepts/nonblocking-schema-changes) to your database tables without locking or causing downtime for production databases.
