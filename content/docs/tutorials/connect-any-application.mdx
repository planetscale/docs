## Introduction

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to connect any application to your PlanetScale database with either username and password or client certificates.

## Prerequisites

- The [PlanetScale CLI](https://github.com/planetscale/cli)
- A [PlanetScale database](/tutorials/planetscale-quick-start-guide)

After you install the PlanetScale CLI, sign in with:

```
pscale auth login
```

## Connect with username and password

This section will show you how to create a username and password for your branch and use those credentials to connect your database to your application.

There are two ways to generate a new username and password for your branch:

- In the PlanetScale dashboard
- With the PlanetScale CLI

This section will cover creating credentials with the CLI, but if you'd prefer to do it in the PlanetScale dashboard, follow the instructions in the [Connection Strings documentation](/concepts/connection-strings#creating-a-password).

Follow the instructions below to create a new username and password for your branch.

1. Run the following command in the CLI to create a new user and password for your branch.

```
pscale password create <DATABASE_NAME> <BRANCH_NAME> <PASSWORD_NAME>
```

<InfoBlock type='note'>
  The <inlineCode>PASSWORD_NAME</inlineCode> value represents the name of the username and password being generated. You can have multiple credentials for a branch, so this gives you a way to categorize them. To manage your passwords in the dashboard, go to your database overview page, click "Settings", and then click "Passwords".
</InfoBlock>

2. Take note of the values it returns to you. You won't be able to see this password again.

```
Password production-password was successfully created.
Please save the values below as they will not be shown again

  NAME                  USERNAME       ACCESS HOST URL                     ROLE               PLAIN TEXT
 --------------------- -------------- ----------------------------------- ------------------ -------------------------------------------------------
  production-password   jp388djdawnod   gxvhbzcxfw01.us-east-2.psdb.cloud   Can Read & Write   pscale_pw_sVkiE_m1111111111111111
```

3. In your application's MySQL configuration file, fill in the following values using the console output from the previous step:

   - **host:** The value for "ACCESS HOST URL" in the above step
   - **port:** `3306`
   - **user:** The value for "USERNAME" in the above step
   - **password:** The value for "PLAIN TEXT" in the above step
   - **database:** `<DATABASE_NAME>`

4. Make sure you correctly configure TLS / SSL for your specific MySQL driver. See [Connecting to PlanetScale securely](/reference/planetscale-security) for more information.

## Connect using client certificates

Another way to connect your application to your PlanetScale database is using client certificates. You won't have to fiddle with configuring any certificates, as that's handled by PlanetScale. It's as simple as a single CLI command.

You'll use the CLI to establish a secure connection to PlanetScale. It will listen on a local port that your application can connect to. This gets rid of the need to generate and remember multiple passwords every time you're creating or switching to a new branch.

1. Run the following command in the CLI:

```
pscale connect <DATABASE_NAME> <BRANCH_NAME>
```

This establishes a secure connection and opens a port on your local machine that you can use to connect to any MySQL client.

2. Take note of the address it returns to you. By default it is `127.0.0.1:3306`. The CLI will use a different port if `3306` is unavailable.

3. In your application's MySQL configuration file, use the following to connect:

   - **host:** `127.0.0.1`
   - **port:** `3306` (the value returned to you by `pscale connect`)
   - **user:** `root`
   - **password:** Leave this blank
   - **database:** `<DATABASE_NAME>`

## What's next?

Now that you've successfully connected your application to PlanetScale, it's time to make schema changes to your tables and deploy your application! Learn more about how PlanetScale allows you to make [non-blocking schema changes](/concepts/nonblocking-schema-changes) to your database tables, without locking or causing downtime for production databases.
