## Introduction

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to connect a Laravel application to a PlanetScale MySQL database using a sample Laravel starter app.

## Prerequisites

- [PHP](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php) &mdash; This tutorial uses `v8.1`
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- A [free PlanetScale account](https://auth.planetscale.com/sign-up)
- [PlanetScale CLI](https://github.com/planetscale/cli) &mdash; You can also follow this tutorial using just the PlanetScale admin dashboard, but the CLI will make setup quicker

## Set up the Laravel app

This guide will integrate [a simple Laravel 8 app](https://github.com/planetscale/laravel-example.git) with PlanetScale that will display a list of stars stored in the database. If you have an existing application, you can also use that.

1. Clone the starter Laravel application:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/planetscale/laravel-example.git
```

2. Enter into the folder and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd laravel-example
composer install
```

3. Copy the `.env.example` file into `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Start the application:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

You can view the application at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## Set up the database

Next, you need to set up your PlanetScale database and connect to it in the Laravel application.

You can create a database either in the [PlanetScale dashboard](https://app.planetscale.com) or from the PlanetScale CLI. This guide will use the CLI, but you can follow the database setup instructions in the [PlanetScale quick start guide](/tutorials/planetscale-quick-start-guide#quick-start-with-the-planetscale-application) if you prefer the dashboard.

1. Authenticate the CLI with the following command:

```bash
pscale auth login
```

2. Create a new database with a default `main` branch with the following command:

```bash
pscale database create <DATABASE_NAME> --region <REGION_SLUG>
```

This tutorial uses `laravel-example` for `DATABASE_NAME`, but you can use any name with lowercase, alphanumeric characters, and dashes or underscores.

For `REGION_SLUG`, choose a region closest to you from the [available regions](/concepts/regions#available-regions) or leave it blank.

That's it! Your database is ready to use. Next, let's connect it to the Laravel application and then add some data.

## Connect to the Laravel app

There are **two ways to connect** to PlanetScale:

- Using client certificates with the CLI
- With an auto-generated username and password

Both options are covered below.

### Option 1: Connect with username and password

1. Create a username and password with the PlanetScale CLI by running:

```bash
pscale password create <DATABASE_NAME> <BRANCH_NAME> <PASSWORD_NAME>
```

<InfoBlock type='note'>
  The <inlineCode>PASSWORD_NAME</inlineCode> value represents the name of the username and password being generated. You can have multiple credentials for a branch, so this gives you a way to categorize them. To manage your passwords in the dashboard, go to your database overview page, click "Settings", and then click "Passwords".
</InfoBlock>

Take note of the values returned to you, as you won't be able to see this password again.

2. Open the `.env` file in your Laravel app, find the database connection section, and fill it in as follows:

```
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=<ACCESS HOST URL> // outputted in the previous step
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=<DATABASE_NAME> // this tutorial uses 'laravel-example'
DB_USERNAME=<USERNAME> // outputted in the previous step
DB_PASSWORD=<PLAIN TEXT> // outputted in the previous step
MYSQL_ATTR_SSL_CA=/etc/ssl/cert.pem
```

You can also get these exact values to to copy/paste from your PlanetScale dashboard. In the dashboard, click on the database > "**Connect**" > "**Generate new password**" > "**General**" dropdown > "**Laravel**".

Refresh your Laravel homepage and you should see the message that you're connected to your database!

### Option 2: Connect with client certificates

To connect with client certificates, you'll need the [PlanetScale CLI](https://github.com/planetscale/cli).

1. Open a connection by running the following:

```bash
pscale connect <DATABASE_NAME> <BRANCH_NAME>
```

If you're following this guide exactly and haven't created any branches, you can use the default branch, `main`.

2. A secure connection to your database will be established and you'll see a local address you can use to connect to your application.

3. Open the `.env` file in your Laravel app and update it as follows:

```
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306 // Get this from the output of the previous step
DB_DATABASE=<DATABASE_NAME>
DB_USERNAME=
DB_PASSWORD=
```

The connection uses port `3306` by default, but if that's being used, it will pick a random port. Make sure you paste in whatever port is returned in the terminal. You can leave `DB_USERNAME` and `DB_PASSWORD` blank.

Refresh your Laravel homepage and you should see the message that you're connected to your database!

## Run migrations and seeder

Now that you're connected, let's add some data to see it in action. The sample application comes with a migration file at `database/migrations/2021_12_20_194637_create_stars_table.php` that will create a `stars` table in the database. There's also a `database/seeders/StarSeeder.php` file that will add two rows to the `stars` table. Let's run those now.

1. Make sure your database connection has been established. You'll see the message "You are connected to your-database-name" on the [Laravel app homepage](http://localhost:8000/) if everything is configured properly.

2. In your terminal in the root of the Laravel project, run the following to run the migration:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

You should get a message that the migration table was successfully created. 

3. Next, seed the database by running:

```bash
php artisan db:seed
```

You should get the message "Database seeding completed successfully".

4. Refresh your Laravel homepage and you'll see a list of stars and their constellations printed out.

The `resources/views/home.blade.php` file pulls this data from the `stars` table with the help of the `app/Http/Controllers/StarController.php` file.

## Add data manually

If you want to continue to play around with adding data on the fly, you have a few options:

- PlanetScale CLI shell
- [Laravel Tinker](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/artisan#tinker)
- PlanetScale dashboard console

The first two options are covered below. To explore the dashboard console, go to your PlanetScale database in the dashboard, click on the branch, and click the "**Console**" tab. 

### Add data with PlanetScale CLI

You can use the PlanetScale CLI to open a MySQL shell to interact with your database.

1. You may need to install the [MySQL command line client](/reference/planetscale-environment-setup) if you haven't already.

2. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pscale shell <DATABASE_NAME> <BRANCH_NAME>
```

This will open up a MySQL shell connected to the specified database and branch.

<InfoBlock type='note'>
  A branch, <inlineCode>main</inlineCode>, was automatically created when you created your database, so you can use that for <inlineCode>BRANCH_NAME</inlineCode>. 
</InfoBlock>

3. Add a record to the `stars` table:

```sql
INSERT INTO `stars` (name, constellation)
VALUES  ('Sagittarius', 'Kaus Media');
```

The values `id`, `created_at`, and `updated_at` will be filled with default values.

4. Type `exit` to exit the shell.

5. Refresh the Laravel homepage to see the new record. You can also verify it was added in the PlanetScale CLI MySQL shell with:

```sql
select * from stars;
```

### Add data with Laravel Tinker

Laravel comes with a powerful tool called [Tinker](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/artisan#tinker) that lets you interact with your database from the command line. Let's add some data with it.

1. In your terminal, run the following command:

```bash
php artisan tinker
```

2. Insert a new record into the `stars` table with:

```php
DB::table('stars')->insert(['name'=>'Sagitarrius', 'constellation'=>'Kaus Media']);
```

The `id`, `created_at`, and `updated_at` will be filled with default values.

3. Refresh your Laravel application homepage to see your new data. You can also run the following command in Tinker to see all records in the `stars` table.

```php
App\Models\Star::all();
```

4. Type `exit` to exit Tinker.

## What's next?

Once you're done with development, you can [promote your `main` branch to production](/concepts/branching#promote-the-main-database-branch) to get a highly available branch protected by direct schema changes.
