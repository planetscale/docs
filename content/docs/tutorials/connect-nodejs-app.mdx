## Introduction

In this tutorial, you'll create a simple Node.js and Express.js application and connect it to a PlanetScale database.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [PlanetScale CLI](https://github.com/planetscale/cli)
- Authenticate the CLI with the following command:

```
pscale auth login
```

## Set up the database

First, create a new database with the following command:

```bash
pscale database create <DATABASE_NAME>
```

Next, let's add some data to the database. You'll create a new table called `users` and add one record to it.

To do this, use the PlanetScale CLI shell to open a MySQL shell where you can manipulate your database. You may need to [install the MySQL command line client](/reference/planetscale-environment-setup) if you haven't already.

```bash
pscale shell <DATABASE_NAME> <BRANCH_NAME>
```

<InfoBlock type='note'>
  A branch, <inlineCode>main</inlineCode>, was automatically created when you created your database, so you can use that for <inlineCode>BRANCH_NAME</inlineCode>. 
</InfoBlock>

Create the `users` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE `users` (
  `id` int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  `email` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `first_name` varchar(255),
  `last_name` varchar(255)
);
```

Then, add a record to it with:

```sql
INSERT INTO `users` (id, email, first_name, last_name)
VALUES  (1, 'hp@example.com', 'Harry', 'Potter');
```

You can verify it was added with:

```sql
select * from users;
```

```
+----+----------------+------------+-----------+
| id | email          | first_name | last_name |
+----+----------------+------------+-----------+
|  1 | hp@example.com | Harry      | Potter    |
+----+----------------+------------+-----------+
```

Next, you'll set up the Express starter application.

## Set up the starter Node.js app

Clone the starter repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/planetscale/express-example.git
```

Enter into the folder and install the dependencies with:

```bash
cd express-example
npm install
```

Now that your application is set up and the database is ready to be used, let's connect them.

## Connect to PlanetScale with Express.js

There are two ways to connect your Express application to your PlanetScale database: **using client certificates** or **using a connection string**. Both options are covered below.

### Using client certificates with the CLI

Use the following command to create a connection to your database and start the application:

```
pscale connect <DATABASE_NAME> <BRANCH_NAME> --execute 'node app.js'
```

<InfoBlock type='note'>
  Running <inlineCode>pscale connect</inlineCode> with the execute flag will pass a <inlineCode>DATABASE_URL</inlineCode> to the Node application, enabling it to connect to PlanetScale. Don't forget to look in <inlineCode>app.js</inlineCode> to see how the DATABASE_URL is used.
</InfoBlock>

Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you'll see the data from your `users` table!

### Using a connection string

This section will show you how to create a username and password through the CLI to connect to your application. If you'd prefer to use the dashboard for this step, you can find those instructions in the [Connection Strings documentation](/concepts/connection-strings#creating-a-password) and then come back here to finish setup.

First, create your `.env` file by renaming the `env.example` file to `.env`:

```bash
mv env.example .env
```

Next, using the PlanetScale CLI, create a new username and password for the branch of your database:

```
pscale password create <DATABASE_NAME> <BRANCH_NAME> <PASSWORD_NAME>
```

<InfoBlock type='note'>
  The <inlineCode>PASSWORD_NAME</inlineCode> value represents the name of the username and password being generated. You can have multiple credentials for a branch, so this gives you a way to categorize them. To manage your passwords in the dashboard, go to your database overview page, click "Settings", and then click "Passwords".
</InfoBlock>

Take note of the values returned to you, as you won't be able to see this password again.

```
Password production-password was successfully created.
Please save the values below as they will not be shown again

  NAME                  USERNAME       ACCESS HOST URL                     ROLE               PLAIN TEXT
 --------------------- -------------- ----------------------------------- ------------------ -------------------------------------------------------
  production-password   jp71f987awnod   gxvhbzcxfw01.us-east-2.psdb.cloud   Can Read & Write   pscale_pw_sVkiE_mtfxQirc4qGZXMf098as90d8as0d98asd
```

You'll use these values to construct your connection string, which will be the value for `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` file. Create your connection string in the following format:

```
"mysql://<USERNAME>:<PLAIN TEXT PASSWORD>@<ACCESS HOST URL>/<DATABASE_NAME>?ssl=true"
```

In the `.env` file, fill in the `DATABASE_URL` variable with the value you constructed. It should look something like this:

```env
DATABASE_URL=mysql://3e98edjddk:pscale_pw_wlksdjlkdc083892332jds@nd2298dss.us-east-3.psdb.cloud/express_database?ssl=true
```

Finally, run your Express application with:

```
node app.js
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you'll see the data from your `users` table!
