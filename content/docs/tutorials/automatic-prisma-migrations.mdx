<InfoBlock type='tip'>
  If you are using PlanetScale with Prisma, go to your database's Settings page in the web app and enable "Automatically
  copy migration data." Select "Prisma" as the migration framework. When enabled, this setting updates the{' '}
  <inlineCode>_prisma_migrations</inlineCode> table each time you branch with the latest migration. If disabled, running{' '}
  <inlineCode>prisma migrate dev</inlineCode> will try to run all migrations every time, instead of only the latest one.

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we’re going to learn how to run automatic Prisma migrations in PlanetScale as part of our deployment process.

### Quick intro to Prisma Migrate

From a high level, [Prisma Migrate](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-migrate) is a imperative database schema migration tool that enables you to keep your database in sync with your Prisma schema as it evovles.

<InfoBlock type='tip'>
  When you merge a deploy request in PlanetScale, the <inlineCode>_prisma_migrations</inlineCode> table in{' '}
  <inlineCode>main</inlineCode> gets automatically updated with the migrations from your branch.

## Prerequisites for this tutorial

- `git clone` this [example project](https://github.com/iheanyi/prisma-planetscale-playground) and run `npm install`.
- Install the [PlanetScale CLI](https://github.com/planetscale/cli).
- Authenticate the CLI with the following command:

```
pscale auth login
```

## Execute first Prisma migration in PlanetScale

Prisma migrations follow the PlanetScale [non-blocking schema change](/concepts/nonblocking-schema-changes) workflow. First, the migration is applied to a _development_ branch and then the development branch is merged into the `main` production database.

Let's begin with an example flow for running Prisma migrations in PlanetScale:

1. Create a new _prisma-playground_ database:

```
pscale db create prisma-playground
```

Make sure to go into your database's Settings page to turn on "Automatically copy migration data" for Prisma after the database is created.

2. Create two _development_ branches from `main`, `initial-setup` and `shadow`:

```
pscale branch create prisma-playground initial-setup
```

```
pscale branch create prisma-playground shadow
```

3. Create an .env file:

```shell
# Environment variables declared in this file are automatically made available to Prisma.
# See the documentation for more detail: https://pris.ly/d/prisma-schema#using-environment-variables

# Prisma supports the native connection string format for PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, SQL Server (Preview) and MongoDB (Preview).
# See the documentation for all the connection string options: https://pris.ly/d/connection-strings

DATABASE_URL="mysql://root@127.0.0.1:3309/prisma-playground"
SHADOW_DATABASE_URL="mysql://root@127.0.0.1:3310/prisma-playground"
```

4. Connect to the two branches:

```
pscale connect prisma-playground initial-setup --port 3309
```

And in another terminal:

```
pscale connect prisma-playground shadow --port 3310
```

5. In another terminal, use the `prisma migrate dev` command to generate and apply migrations:

```
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

This Prisma command replays the existing migration history in the shadow database, applies pending migrations, generates a new migration from any changes you made, applies all unapplicated migrations to the development branch, and updates the `_prisma_migrations` table.

The `prisma migrate dev` command will create a SQL file like `prisma/migrations/20210806002614_init/migration.sql` (the exact folder will match the current timestamp and name). If your account doesn't have a databased named `prisma-playground` yet, you should run `npx prisma db push`.

<InfoBlock type='tip'>
  You can learn more about the <inlineCode>prisma migrate dev</inlineCode> command in the{' '}
  <a href='https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-migrate#development-environments'>Prisma docs</a>.
</InfoBlock>

Along with the creation of new tables (User, Post, Profile), `20210806002614_init` (the exact string will match the current timestamp) has been inserted into the `_prisma_migrations` table on your `initial_setup` development branch.

6. Open a deploy request for your `initial-setup` branch, so that you can deploy your changes to `main`:

```
pscale deploy-request create prisma-playground initial-setup
```

You can complete the deploy request either in the web app or with the `pscale deploy-request` command.

This step creates the `User`, `Post`, and `Profile` tables in production. Once merged, PlanetScale will also insert `20210806002614_init` into `main`’s `_prisma_migrations` table.

7. Once the deploy request is merged, you can see the migration in your main branch's `_prisma_migrations` table:

```
pscale shell prisma-playground main
```

```SQL
SELECT * from _prisma_migrations;
```

You did it! You successfully ran automatic Prisma migrations in PlanetScale.

## Execute succeeding Prisma migrations in PlanetScale

Our first example migration flow went well, but what happens when you need to run further migrations?

Let’s take a look:

1. Delete your previous `shadow` and `initial-setup` branches:

```
pscale branch delete prisma-playground shadow
```

```
pscale branch delete prisma-playground initial-setup
```

Since shadow databases are created and deleted automatically each time you run a development-focused Prisma command, we need to delete shadow _development_ branches in PlanetScale.

2. Create two _development_ branches from `main`, `add-subtitle-to-posts` and `shadow`:

```
pscale branch create prisma-playground add-subtitle-to-posts
```

```
pscale branch create prisma-playground shadow-2
```

As part of creating that branch, PlanetScale copies _every_ row from `main`’s `_prisma_migrations` table over to your new development branch.

3. Close the existing proxy connections and connect to the two new branches:

```
pscale connect prisma-playground add-subtitle-to-posts --port 3309
```

And in another terminal:

```
pscale connect prisma-playground shadow-2 --port 3310
```

4. In the `prisma/schema.prisma` file, update the `Post` model:

You can add a new `subtitle` field:

```
subtitle  String   @db.VarChar(255)
```

5. Create another Prisma migration for your table and call it `add-subtitle-to-posts`:

```
npx prisma migrate dev --name add-subtitle-to-posts
```

Prisma migrate checks `_prisma_migrations` to ensure your `create_users` migration already ran and proceeds to only run your new migration. In some cases, it might detect drift depending on your change.

6. Open a deploy request for your `add-subtitle-to-posts` branch, so that you can deploy these changes to `main`.

You can complete the deploy request either in the web app or with the `pscale deploy-request` command.

7. Once the deploy request is merged, you can see the migration in your main branch's `_prisma_migrations` table:

```
pscale shell prisma-playground main
```

```SQL
SELECT * from _prisma_migrations;
```

## What's next?

Now that you've successfully conducted your first automatic Prisma migration in PlanetScale and know how to handle future migrations, it's time to deploy your application with a PlanetScale database! Let's learn how to [deploy an application with a PlanetScale database to Vercel](/tutorial/deploy-to-vercel).
