## Introduction

In this tutorial, you’re going to create a simple Rails application named _blog_ and connect it to a PlanetScale database. You’ll perform the initial migration from your local Rails application, and set up the database for future development.

## Prerequisites

- Install [Ruby and the Rails gem](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#creating-a-new-rails-project-installing-rails).
- Install the [PlanetScale CLI](https://github.com/planetscale/cli).
- Authenticate the CLI with the following command:

```
pscale auth login
```

## Create a Rails project

To connect a Rails application to a PlanetScale database, you'll first create a sample Rails project named _blog_ and install the libraries needed to connect to your PlanetScale database.

Open the command line and follow these steps:

1. Create a Rails app named _blog_ by running the following command:

```
rails new blog
```

2. Change into the directory you just created, the `blog` Rails app:

```
cd blog
```

3. Next, add the `mysql2` gem to your _Gemfile_:

```ruby
gem "mysql2"
```

4. Then run `bundle install`

At this point, you have accomplished two things: you've created a Rails project called _blog_ and installed the libraries that you'll need to connect to your PlanetScale database. Now, it’s time to create a PlanetScale database.

## Create a PlanetScale database and password

**Note**: You can also create passwords in the PlanetScale dashboard, as documented [in our Creating a password documentation](/concepts/connection-strings#creating-a-password).

### Using the CLI to create a connection string

1. Using the `pscale` CLI, create a new database also named _blog_:

```
pscale database create blog
```

2. Using the `pscale` CLI, create a new database password for the `main` branch of your database named _blog_:

```
pscale password create blog main <PASSWORD_NAME>
```

<InfoBlock type='note'>
  The `PASSWORD_NAME` value represents the name of the username and password being generated. You can have multiple credentials for a branch, so this gives you a way to categorize them. To manage your passwords in the dashboard, go to your database overview page, click "Settings", and then click "Passwords".
</InfoBlock>

3. Take note of the values returned to you, as they will not be shown again.

```
  NAME                  BRANCH   USERNAME       ACCESS HOST URL                     ROLE     ROLE DESCRIPTION   PASSWORD
 --------------------- -------- -------------- ----------------------------------- -------- ------------------ -------------------------------------------------------
  development-password  main     xxxxxxxx   xxxxxxxxxx.us-east-3.psdb.cloud   writer   Can Read & Write   pscale_pw_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

## Configure Rails and PlanetScale

Let's set up the Rails application to talk to the new database.

1. Open `config/database.yml` and configure the `development` database settings with your new credentials from the output in the previous step:

```yaml
development:
  <<: *default
  adapter: mysql2
  database: blog
  username: <USERNAME>
  host: <ACCESS HOST URL>
  password: <PASSWORD>
  ssl_mode: :verify_identity
  sslca: "/etc/ssl/cert.pem"
```

The correct `sslca` path depends on your operating system and distribution. See [CA root configuration](/reference/planetscale-security#ca-root-configuration) for more information.

<InfoBlock type='note'>
  You're configuring the <b>development</b> Rails environment here for the sake of expedience. In actual use, the <b>main</b> database branch would typically serve the <b>production</b> environment.
</InfoBlock>

Because this is a Rails app, you can also enable [Automatic Rails migrations](/tutorials/automatic-rails-migrations) from the database's settings page. Select your database, click on the `main` branch, click "**Settings**", check the "**Automatically copy migration data**" box, and select "**Rails**" from the dropdown.

## Migrate your database

Here comes the fun stuff! Now that your application is configured to talk to PlanetScale, you can create your first migration.

1. Create a Rails migration and call it `CreateUsers`:

```
rails generate migration CreateUsers
```

This rails command begins the migration for your table that is currently empty and generates a Ruby file that’ll be named something like this:
`db/migrate/20211014210422_create_users.rb`

2. Fill in the body of this skeleton file with a few more relevant details, such as a user's **name** and **email**.

```ruby
class CreateUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.1]
  def change
    create_table :users do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.string :email
      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
```

3. Run your migration:

```
bin/rails db:migrate
```

4. Now, give it a whirl to make sure you can query the new table with the `pscale` CLI:

```
pscale shell blog main
```

```sql
blog/main> show tables;
+----------------------+
| Tables_in_blog       |
+----------------------+
| ar_internal_metadata |
| schema_migrations    |
| users                |
+----------------------+
blog/main> describe users;
+------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| Field      | Type         | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
+------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| id         | bigint       | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |
| name       | varchar(255) | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
| email      | varchar(255) | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
| created_at | datetime(6)  | NO   |     | NULL    |                |
| updated_at | datetime(6)  | NO   |     | NULL    |                |
+------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
```

## Promote your main branch to a production branch

A production branch is a highly available, protected database branch. Direct schema changes (`CREATE`, `ALTER`, and `DELETE`) are not allowed on production branches to prevent accidental data loss and must be applied via [deploy requests](/concepts/planetscale-workflow).

```
pscale branch promote blog main
```

Congratulations! You're ready to develop your Rails application against PlanetScale.

## Summary

In this tutorial, you created a simple Rails application named _blog_ and connected it to a PlanetScale database.

## What's next?

Now that you've successfully connected your Rails app to PlanetScale, it's time to make more schema changes to your tables! Learn more about how PlanetScale allows you to make [non-blocking schema changes](/concepts/nonblocking-schema-changes) to your database, or how to keep your **schema_migrations** table up-to-date between development and production branches with [automatic schema migrations](/tutorials/automatic-rails-migrations).
