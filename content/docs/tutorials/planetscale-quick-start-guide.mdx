## Overview

The following guide will show you how to:

- Create a database with PlanetScale
- Make a schema change
- Insert data
- Promote your database branch to production

If you already have your PlanetScale database set up, you may find the [Connecting your application](/docs/tutorials/connect-any-application) or [Branching](/docs/concepts/branching) guides more helpful.

This guide is split up so that you can either follow it in the [PlanetScale dashboard](#getting-started-—-planetscale-dashboard) or using the [PlanetScale CLI](#getting-started-—-planetscale-cli).

## Getting started &mdash; PlanetScale dashboard

You'll need [ a PlanetScale account](https://auth.planetscale.com/sign-up) to complete this guide.

### Create a database

Follow these steps to create a database:

1. Click the "**Create a database**" button on your organization's overview page.
2. Name your database using lowercase, alphanumeric characters or underscores. You may also use dashes, but we don't recommend that, as sharded databases require them to be escaped.
3. Select a [region](/docs/concepts/regions). For the lowest latency, select a region near you or your application's hosting location.
4. Finally, click the "**Create database**" button to deploy your database.

![Create database modal](/docs/img/docs/quickstart-create-database.png)

Your database is created with an [**initial development branch**](/docs/concepts/branching), `main`, which you will use to apply a schema change and insert data. Think of this as your development environment where you can test schema changes before deploying your database to production. Once you promote your branch to production, you can always create new branches (isolated copies of the production schema) off of production to use for development.

### Add a schema to your database

This quickstart demonstrates how to create and use two relational tables: `categories` and `products`.

1. From your database's overview page, click on the "**Branches**" tab in the database navigation.

![Create database modal](/docs/img/docs/quickstart-branch-overview.png)

2. Click on the `main` branch.
3. Click on the "**Console**" tab. This will open up a [web console](/docs/concepts/web-console) connected to your database branch.
4. Create the `categories` and `products` tables by running the following commands in the web console:

```sql
CREATE TABLE categories (
  id int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  name varchar(255) NOT NULL
);
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
  id int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  name varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  image_url varchar(255),
  category_id INT,
  KEY category_id_idx (category_id)
);
```

<InfoBlock type='note'>
  PlanetScale does not support foreign key <i>constraints</i>, but we do support the use of relationships with foreign
  keys, as shown in this example. For more information, check out our{' '}
  <a href='/learn/operating-without-foreign-key-constraints'>Operating without foreign key constraints</a>{' '}
  documentation.
</InfoBlock>

5. You can confirm that the tables have been added by running:

```sql
SHOW TABLES;
```

### Insert data into your database

Now that you have created your tables, let's insert some data. Run the following commands to add a product and category to your tables:

```sql
INSERT INTO categories (name)
VALUES  ('Office supplies');
```

```sql
INSERT INTO products (name, image_url, category_id)
VALUES  ('Ballpoint pen', 'https://example.com/500x500', '1');
```

You can confirm the data has been added with:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products;
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM categories;
```

If you click on the "**Schema**" tab in the database navigation and click the "**Refresh schema**" button, you'll see the new database schema.

### Promote your database branch to production

All of the work you've done so far has been on a development branch, `main`, that was automatically created when you created the database.

<InfoBlock type='note'>
  A development branch is intended for applying schema changes and is <b>not intended for use in production</b>.
</InfoBlock>

Once you are happy with the changes you have made to your development branch, you can promote the branch to production.

A production branch is a highly available, protected database branch with automated scheduled backups designed for use in production. Schema changes, such as `CREATE`, `ALTER`, and `DELETE`, are **not allowed** on production branches to prevent accidental data loss.

### To promote a branch to production:

1. Click "Overview" in the navigation, and you'll see a banner with information about promoting to production.

![Create database modal](/docs/img/docs/quickstart-promote-branch-overview.png)

2. Click the "Promote branch" button.
3. In the modal that opens, select the branch you want to promote to production
4. Click "Promote branch"

The `main` branch is now your production branch. It contains the `categories` and `products` tables you created, along with the data you inserted. In addition, a production branch provides:

- Protection from direct schema changes
- High availability
- Automatic daily scheduled backups

### What's next?

Now that you've created a database, applied schema changes, added data, and promoted your branch to production, it's time to connect to your application.

You can use our [Connect Any Application tutorial](/docs/tutorials/connect-any-application) for a general step-by-step approach, one of our language-specific guides, or head straight to our [Connection Strings documentation](/docs/concepts/connection-strings) for more information about creating connection strings.

When you want to continue development on your database:

1. [Create a new branch](/docs/concepts/branching) off of your production branch
2. Go through the same process described in this doc to make schema changes
3. [Create a deploy request](/docs/concepts/deploy-requests) to merge the changes into your production branch

<InfoBlock type='note'>
  When you branch off of a production branch, your development branch will have the same schema as production, but it{' '}
  <b>will not</b> copy over any data from the production database. We suggest seeding development branches with mock
  data.
</InfoBlock>

## Getting started &mdash; PlanetScale CLI

Make sure you first have [downloaded and installed the PlanetScale CLI](https://github.com/planetscale/cli#installation).

You will also need a PlanetScale account. You can [sign up for a free PlanetScale account here](https://auth.planetscale.com/sign-up) or run `pscale signup` to create an account straight from the CLI.

### Sign in to your account

To authenticate with the PlanetScale CLI, enter the following:

```bash
pscale auth login
```

You'll be taken to a screen in the browser where you'll be asked to confirm the code displayed in your terminal. If the confirmation codes match, click the "**Confirm code**" button in your browser.

You should receive the message "Successfully logged in" in your terminal. You can now close the confirmation page in the browser and proceed in the terminal.

### Create a database

Run the following command to create a database:

```bash
pscale database create <DATABASE_NAME> --region <REGION_SLUG>
```

- **DATABASE_NAME** &mdash; Your database name can contain lowercase, alphanumeric characters, or underscores. We allow dashes, but don't recommend them, as they may need to be escaped in some instances.
- **REGION_SLUG** &mdash; For the lowest latency, choose the region closest to you or your application's hosting location. You can find our regions and their slugs on the [Regions page](/docs/concepts/regions#available-regions).

<InfoBlock type='note'>
  If you do not specify a region, your database will automatically be deployed to <b>US East - Northern Virginia</b>.
</InfoBlock>

Your database will deploy with an initial development branch, `main`, which you will use to apply a schema change and insert data. Think of this as your development environment where you can test schema changes before deploying your database to production. Once you promote your branch to production, you can always create new branches (isolated copies of the production schema) off of production to use for development.

### Add a schema to your database

To add a schema to your database, you will need to connect to MySQL, so [make sure you `mysql-client` installed](/docs/concepts/planetscale-environment-setup#setup-overview).

1. Run the following command:

```
pscale shell <DATABASE_NAME> main
```

You are now connected to your `main` branch and can run MySQL queries against it.

2. Create the `categories` and `products` tables by running the following:

```sql
CREATE TABLE categories (
  id int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  name varchar(255) NOT NULL
);
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
  id int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  name varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  image_url varchar(255),
  category_id INT,
  KEY category_id_idx (category_id)
);
```

<InfoBlock type='note'>
  PlanetScale does not support foreign key <i>constraints</i>, but we do support the use of relationships with foreign
  keys, as shown in this example. For more information, check out our{' '}
  <a href='/learn/operating-without-foreign-key-constraints'>Operating without foreign key constraints</a>{' '}
  documentation.
</InfoBlock>

3. You can confirm that the table has been added by running:

```sql
SHOW TABLES;
```

4. To see the table schemas, run:

```sql
DESCRIBE categories;
```

```sql
DESCRIBE products;
```

### Insert data into your database

Now that you have your schema set up, let's insert some data.

1. Run the following commands to add one entry to each table:

```sql
INSERT INTO `categories` (name)
VALUES  ('Office supplies');
```

```sql
INSERT INTO `products` (name, image_url, category_id)
VALUES  ('Ballpoint pen', 'https://example.com/500x500', '1');
```

2. You can confirm the data has been added with:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products;
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM categories;
```

3. Exit the shell by typing `exit`.

### Promote your database branch to production

All of the work you've done so far has been on a development branch, `main`, that was automatically created when you created the database.

<InfoBlock type='note'>

A production branch is a highly available, protected database branch with automated scheduled backups designed for use in production. Schema changes, such as `CREATE`, `ALTER`, and `DELETE`, are **not allowed** on production branches to prevent accidental data loss.

To promote your branch to production, run:

```bash
pscale branch promote <DATABASE_NAME> main
```

The `main` branch is now your production branch. It contains the `categories` and `products` tables you created, along with the data you inserted. In addition, a production branch provides:

- Protection from direct schema changes
- High availability
- Automatic daily scheduled backups
