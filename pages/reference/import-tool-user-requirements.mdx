When importing a database using our [Import tool](/docs/concepts/database-imports), you will need to connect to your existing database with a user that has the proper permissions to set up the necessary configurations to start importing data.

Below is the minimum set of permissions needed and what each allows the user to do:

| Scope  | Databases                | Grant                | Description                                                                  |
| ------ | ------------------------ | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Global | n/a                      | `PROCESS`            | Enable the user to see all processes with SHOW PROCESSLIST.                  |
| Global | n/a                      | `REPLICATION SLAVE`  | Enable replicas to read binary log events from the source.                   |
| Global | n/a                      | `REPLICATION CLIENT` | Enable the user to ask where source or replica servers are.                  |
| Table  | `<DATABASE_NAME>`, `_vt` | `SELECT`             | Enable use of SELECT.                                                        |
| Table  | `<DATABASE_NAME>`, `_vt` | `INSERT`             | Enable use of INSERT.                                                        |
| Table  | `<DATABASE_NAME>`        | `LOCK TABLES`        | Enable use of LOCK TABLES on tables for which you have the SELECT privilege. |
| Table  | `<DATABASE_NAME>`, `_vt` | `UPDATE`             | Enable use of UPDATE.                                                        |
| Table  | `<DATABASE_NAME>`, `_vt` | `DELETE`             | Enable use of DELETE.                                                        |
| Table  | `_vt`                    | `CREATE`             | Enable database and table creation.                                          |
| Table  | `_vt`                    | `DROP`               | Enable databases, tables, and views to be dropped.                           |
| Table  | `_vt`                    | `ALTER`              | Enable use of ALTER TABLE.                                                   |

## Script to create user

This script can be used to create a user with the necessary permissions. The username will be `migration_user`. You will need to update the following variables:

- `<SUPER_STRONG_PASSWORD>` &mdash; The password for the `migration_user` account.
- `<DATABASE_NAME>` &mdash; The name of the database you will import into PlanetScale.

```sql
CREATE USER 'migration_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '<SUPER_STRONG_PASSWORD>';
GRANT PROCESS, REPLICATION SLAVE, REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'migration_user'@'%';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, LOCK TABLES ON <DATABASE_NAME>.* TO 'migration_user'@'%';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, ALTER ON '_vt'.* TO 'migration_user'@'%';
```
