## Overview

PlanetScale is built on top of open-source Vitess, a database clustering system for horizontal scaling of MySQL. Consequently, PlanetScale is only compatible with MySQL databases.

If you're [importing an existing database](/docs/concepts/database-imports), PlanetScale supports MySQL database versions `5.7` through `8.0`.

New PlanetScale databases are created on MySQL 8 with character set `utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci`. PlanetScale only supports `utf8`, `utf8mb4`, and `utf8mb3` character sets.

## MySQL compatibility limitations

The following reference guide will cover some MySQL syntax, features, and more that PlanetScale either does not support or has limitations around. We are actively working on driving up compatibility, but it's an ongoing effort and will take some time to complete. See this [project board on GitHub](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/projects/4) to learn what the Vitess team is currently focusing on.

If you're attempting to import a database using our Import tool, there are some additional requirements that you can find in our [Database imports documentation](/docs/concepts/database-imports#import-limitations).

### Queries, functions, syntax, data types, and SQL modes

<InfoBlock>
❗ = <i>Limitations in support</i> <br/>
✖️ = <i>Not supported</i>
</InfoBlock>

| Statement     | Support | Description |
| ------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `CONSTRAINT...FOREIGN KEY` | ✖️ | The usage of foreign key constraints or `FOREIGN KEY` syntax is [not supported on PlanetScale](/docs/learn/operating-without-foreign-key-constraints). |
| `ALTER TABLE...RENAME COLUMN` | ✖️ | Renaming columns and tables may be destructive. See our [guide for column rename recommendations](/docs/learn/handling-table-and-column-renames).    |
| `CREATE DATABASE` | ✖️ | You cannot `CREATE` a PlanetScale database from the MySQL command line, however, this is supported in the [PlanetScale CLI](/docs/reference/database). |
| `DROP DATABASE` | ✖️ | You cannot `DROP` a PlanetScale database from the MYSQL command line, however, this is supported in the [PlanetScale CLI](/docs/reference/database). |
| `JSON_*` | ✖️ | Not all [JSON functions](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/json-function-reference.html) are supported. |
| `PROCEDURE` | ✖️ | We do not support any form of [stored routines](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/stored-routines.html). |
| `FUNCTION` | ✖️ | We do not support any form of [stored routines](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/stored-routines.html). |
| `TRIGGER` | ✖️ | We do not support any form of [stored routines](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/stored-routines.html). |
| `EVENT` | ✖️ | We do not support any form of [stored routines](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/stored-routines.html). |
| `LOAD DATA INFILE` | ✖️ | Loading data via [`LOAD DATA INFILE` is not supported](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/2976). |
| `KILL` | ✖️ | We do not support killing queries or shards from the command line. |
| `PIPES_AS_CONCAT` | ✖️ | Enabling this SQL mode can interfere with Vitess' evalengine parsing the SQL queries so enabling it may result in incorrect or unexpected results. Please use MySQL's standard dialect instead, e.g. `CONCAT()`. |
| `ANSI_QUOTES` | ✖️ | Enabling this SQL mode can interfere with Vitess' evalengine parsing the SQL queries so enabling it may result in incorrect or unexpected results. Please use MySQL's standard quotation instead. |

## Miscellaneous

| Action     | Support | Description |
| ------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Empty schemas** | ✖️ | Databases with empty schemas are invalid. You cannot deploy a schema change to production if no tables exist. |
| **Non-InnoDB Storage engine** | ✖️ | We only support [InnoDB](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-storage-engine.html) storage engine. |
| **No unique key** | ✖️ | We require all tables have a [unique, non-null key](/docs/learn/change-single-unique-key) that remains unchanged during migrations. |
| **Direct DDL** | ✖️ | We do [not allow Direct DDL](/docs/learn/how-online-schema-change-tools-work) on [production branches](/docs/concepts/branching). |
| **Disabled binary logs** | ❗ | You must have binary logs enabled if importing a database using our [database importer tool](/docs/concepts/database-imports). See our [Import doc](/docs/concepts/database-imports#server-configuration-issues) for more required configuration. |
