## Overview

This guide will cover how and why to use the PlanetScale serverless driver for JavaScript in your projects. Before following this guide, make sure you've [enabled the feature](/docs/tutorials/planetscale-serverless-driver) and created a password to use with the driver.

## Add and use the PlanetScale serverless driver for JavaScript to your project

To install the package in your project, run the following install command:

```bash
npm install @planetscale/database
```

The first step to using the PlanetScale serverless driver for JavaScript is to connect to your database. Use the `connect` function to create the connection and return it to an object.

```js
const config = {
  host: '<PS_HOSTNAME>',
  username: '<PS_USERNAME>',
  password: '<PS_PASSWORD>'
}
const conn = await connect(config)
```

To execute a query, use the `execute` function of the connection object, with the query passed as the first parameter.

```js
const results = await conn.execute('SELECT * FROM hotels')
```

Here is the content of the `results` object from the `SELECT` statement:

```js
{
  headers: [ 'id', 'name', 'address', 'stars' ],
  types: {
    id: 'UINT32',
    name: 'VARCHAR',
    address: 'VARCHAR',
    stars: 'FLOAT32'
  },
  rows: [
    {
      id: 1,
      name: 'Four Seasons Resort Jackson hole',
      address: '7680 Granite Loop Rd, Teton Village, WY 83025',
      stars: 4.7
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      name: 'The Galt House',
      address: '140 N Fourth St, Louisville, KY 40202',
      stars: 4
    },
    ...results removed for brevity
  ],
  rowsAffected: null,
  insertId: null,
  error: null,
  size: 5,
  statement: 'SELECT * FROM hotels',
  time: 136
}
```

For parameterized queries, there are two ways in which to pass data to the query. The first is by the order in which they appear in the query. The first step is to add a `?` in the specific locations you want the parameters passed into.

```js
const query = 'INSERT INTO hotels (`name`, `address`, `stars`) VALUES (?, ?, ?)'
```

Then you can pass your parameters as an array of values. The driver package will replace the `?` entries in the query with the values passed in the array, in the order in which they were placed.

```js
const params = ['The Galt House', '140 N Fourth St, Louisville, KY 40202', 4.2)
const results = await conn.execute(query, params)
```

Here is the content of the `results` object for the `INSERT` statement:

```js
{
  headers: [],
  types: {},
  rows: [],
  rowsAffected: 1,
  insertId: '6',
  error: null,
  size: 0,
  statement: "INSERT INTO hotels (`name`, `address`, `stars`) VALUES ('Montage Kapalua Bay 2', '1 Bay Dr, Lahaina, HI 96761', 4)",
  time: 102
}
```

Alternately, you can name your parameters using the `:param_name` format. 

```js
const query = 'INSERT INTO hotels (`name`, `address`, `stars`) VALUES (:name, :address :stars)'
const params = {
  name: 'The Galt House',
  address: '140 N Fourth St, Louisville, KY 40202',
  stars: 4.2
}
const results = await conn.execute(query, params)
```
