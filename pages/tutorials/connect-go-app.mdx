## Introduction

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to connect a Go application to a PlanetScale MySQL database using a sample Go starter app with GORM.

<InfoBlock type='tip'>
  Already have a Go application and just want to connect to PlanetScale? Check out the [Go quick connect repo](https://github.com/planetscale/connection-examples/tree/main/go).
</InfoBlock>

## Prerequisites

- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- A [free PlanetScale account](https://auth.planetscale.com/sign-up)
- [PlanetScale CLI](https://github.com/planetscale/cli) &mdash; You can also follow this tutorial in the PlanetScale admin dashboard, but the CLI will make setup quicker.

## Set up the Go app

This guide will integrate [a simple Go (Golang) app](https://github.com/planetscale/golang-example) with PlanetScale that will display a list of products stored in the database. If you have an existing application, you can also use that.

1. Clone the starter Go application:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/planetscale/golang-example.git
```

2. Enter into the folder:

```bash
cd golang-example
```

3. Copy the `.env.example` file into `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

## Set up the database

Next, you need to set up your PlanetScale database and connect to it in the Go application.

You can create a database in the [PlanetScale dashboard](https://app.planetscale.com) or from the PlanetScale CLI. This guide will use the CLI, but you can follow the database setup instructions in the [PlanetScale quickstart guide](/docs/tutorials/planetscale-quick-start-guide) if you prefer the dashboard.

1. Authenticate the CLI with the following command:

```bash
pscale auth login
```

2. Create a new database with a default `main` branch with the following command:

```bash
pscale database create <DATABASE_NAME> --region <REGION_SLUG>
```

For `DATABASE_NAME`, you can use any name with lowercase, alphanumeric characters, or underscores. You can also use dashes, but we don't recommend them, as they may need to be escaped in some instances.

For `REGION_SLUG`, choose a region closest to you from the [available regions](/docs/concepts/regions#available-regions) or leave it blank.

That's it! Your database is ready to use. Next, let's connect it to the Go application and then add some data.

## Connect to the Go app

There are **two ways to connect** your Go app to PlanetScale:

- With an auto-generated username and password
- Using the PlanetScale proxy with the CLI

Both options are covered below.

### Option 1: Connect with username and password (Recommended)

1. Create a username and password with the PlanetScale CLI by running:

```bash
pscale password create <DATABASE_NAME> <BRANCH_NAME> <PASSWORD_NAME>
```

A default branch, `main`, is created when you create the database, so you can use that for `BRANCH_NAME`.

<InfoBlock type='note'>
  The `PASSWORD_NAME` value represents the name of the username and password being generated. You can have multiple credentials for a branch, so this gives you a way to categorize them. To manage your passwords in the dashboard, go to your database overview page, click "Settings", and then click "Passwords".
</InfoBlock>

Take note of the values returned to you, as you won't be able to see this password again.

2. Open the `.env` file in your Go app and update `DSN` as follows:

```
DSN="<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@tcp(<ACCESS HOST URL>)/<DATABASE_NAME>?tls=true"
```

Fill in `USERNAME`, `PASSWORD`, `ACCESS HOST URL`, and `DATABASE_NAME` with the appropriate values from the CLI output above. Do not remove the parentheses around the access host URL.

You can also get these exact values to copy/paste from your PlanetScale dashboard. In the dashboard, click on the database > "**Connect**" > "**Connect with**" language dropdown > "**Go**".

### Option 2: Connect with the PlanetScale proxy

To connect with the PlanetScale proxy, you need the [PlanetScale CLI](https://github.com/planetscale/cli).

1. Open a connection by running the following:

```bash
pscale connect <DATABASE_NAME> <BRANCH_NAME>
```

If you're following this guide exactly and haven't created any branches, you can use the default branch, `main`.

2. A secure connection to your database will be established, and you'll see a local address you can use to connect to your application.

3. Open the `.env` file in your Go app and update it as follows:

```
DSN="mysql://root@tcp(127.0.0.1:<PORT>)/<DATABASE_NAME>"
```

The connection uses port `3306` by default, but if that's being used, it will pick a random port. Make sure you paste in whatever port is returned in the terminal. Fill in the database name as well.

## Run migrations and seeder

Now that you're connected let's add some data to see it in action. The sample application has an endpoint that you can use to run migrations to create your `categories` and `products` tables. It will seed your database with sample product and category data. You can find this in `main.go`.

Let's run those now.

1. First, start your Go app with:

```bash
go run .
```

2. Next, navigate to [`localhost:8080/seed`](http://localhost:8080/seed) to run the migrations and the seeder.

3. You can now see the products and categories:

- Get all products &mdash; [`localhost:8080/products`](http://localhost:8080/products)
- Get all categories &mdash; [`localhost:8080/categories`](http://localhost:8080/categories)
- Get a single product &mdash; [`localhost:8080/product/{id}`](http://localhost:8080/products/1)
- Get a single category &mdash; [`localhost:8080/category/{id}`](http://localhost:8080/categories/1)

### Foreign key constraints

If you're using GORM in your Go application, take note of this line in the `main.go` file of the Go starter application:

```go
// ...
DisableForeignKeyConstraintWhenMigrating: true,
// ...
```

PlanetScale does not support foreign key *constraints*, but we do support the use of relationships with foreign keys, as shown in this example. For more information, check out our [Operating without foreign key constraints](/docs/learn/operating-without-foreign-key-constraints) documentation.

## Add data manually

If you want to continue to play around with adding data on the fly, you have a few options:

- PlanetScale CLI shell
- PlanetScale dashboard console
- Your favorite MySQL client (E.g. [Arctype](https://arctype.com/mysql/setup/planetscale-mac), TablePlus, DataGrip, etc.)

The first two options are covered below.

### Add data with PlanetScale CLI

You can use the PlanetScale CLI to open a MySQL shell to interact with your database.

You may need to install the MySQL command line client if you haven't already.

1. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pscale shell <DATABASE_NAME> <BRANCH_NAME>
```

This will open up a MySQL shell connected to the specified database and branch.

<InfoBlock type='note'>
  A branch, `main`, was automatically created when you created your database, so you can use that for `BRANCH_NAME`.
</InfoBlock>

2. Add a record to the `products` table:

```sql
INSERT INTO `products` (name, description, image, category_id)
VALUES  ('Spaceship', 'Get ready for the trip of a lifetime', 'https://via.placeholder.com/300.png', 2);
```
The value `id` will be filled with a default value.

3. You can verify it was added in the PlanetScale CLI MySQL shell with:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products;
```

4. Type `exit` to exit the shell.

You can now navigated the [Go products page](http://localhost:8080/products) to see the new record.

### Add data with PlanetScale dashboard console

If you don't care to install MySQL client or the PlanetScale CLI, another quick option is using the MySQL console built into the PlanetScale dashboard.

<ImageBlock alt='PlanetScale console insert and select example' src={console} />

1. Go to your [PlanetScale dashboard](https://app.planetscale.com) and select your Go database.
2. Click on the "**Branches** and select the `main` branch.
3. Click on "**Console**"
4. Add a new record to the `product` table with:

```sql
INSERT INTO `products` (name, description, image, category_id)
VALUES  ('Spaceship', 'Get ready for the trip of a lifetime', 'https://via.placeholder.com/300.png', 2);
```

5. You can confirm that it was added by running:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products;
```

You can now refresh the [Go products page](http://localhost:8080/products) to see the new record.

## What's next?

Once you're done with development, you can [promote your `main` branch to production](/docs/concepts/branching#promote-a-branch-to-production) to get a highly available branch protected by direct schema changes.

When you're reading to make more schema changes, you'll [create a new branch](/docs/concepts/branching) off of your production branch. Branching your database creates an isolated copy of your production schema so that you can easily test schema changes in development. Once you're happy with the changes, you'll open a [deploy request](/docs/concepts/deploy-requests). This will generate a diff showing the changes that will be deployed, making it easy for your team to review.

Learn more about how PlanetScale allows you to make [non-blocking schema changes](/docs/concepts/nonblocking-schema-changes) to your database tables without locking or causing downtime for production databases.
