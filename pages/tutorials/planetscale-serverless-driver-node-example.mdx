## Overview

This guide will cover how to use the provided Node.js sample application using the PlanetScale serverless driver for JavaScript. Before following this guide, make sure you've [enabled the feature](/docs/tutorials/planetscale-serverless-driver) and created a password to use with the driver.

## Use the sample repository

We offer a sample repository that can be used as an educational resource. It is an Express API that can be run locally with sample `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements mapped to the proper API endpoints.

To follow along, youâ€™ll need the following:

- A PlanetScale account, as well as knowing how to create a database.
- The PlanetScale CLI is installed on your computer, which will be used to seed data.

Start by creating a database in PlanetScale by clicking **"New database"** > **"Create new database"**. 

![How to create a new database.](/docs/img/docs/using-the-planetscale-serverless-driver-for-js/how-to-create-a-new-database.png)

Name the database `travel_db`. Click **"Create database"**.

Wait for the database to finish initializing before moving on.

Enable the **PlanetScale serverless driver for JavaScript** feature by clicking on **"Settings"** > **"Beta features"**, then clicking **"Enroll"** in the PlanetScale serverless driver for JavaScript section.

Generate a set of credentials by clicking the **"Connect"** button. 

![The Connect button in the PlanetScale dashboard.](/docs/img/docs/using-the-planetscale-serverless-driver-for-js/the-connect-button-in-the-planetscale-dashboard.png)

Select **"@planetscale/database"** from the options in the **"Connect with"** dropdown. Copy the text from the **".env"** tab as we'll be putting this in the project after it's pulled down from GitHub.

On your workstation, open a terminal and clone the repository to your computer by running the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/planetscale/database-js-starter
```

Navigate to the `scripts` folder and run the `seed_database.sh` script to populate a small database simulating a travel agency.

```bash
cd database-js-starter/scripts
./seed-database.sh
```

If you are using Windows, run this command through the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/)

Create a new file file named `.env` in the root of the project and paste in the sample provided from PlanetScale.

![The .env example.](/docs/img/docs/using-the-planetscale-serverless-driver-for-js/the-env-example.png)

To run the project, run the following commands from the root of the project.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

If the project is running properly, you should receive a message stating that the API is running.

The `tests.http` file is designed to work with the [VS Code Rest Client plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client), but can be used as a reference when testing with the tool of your choosing. If you are using the plugin, you may click the **"Send request"** button that appears above each request to see the API in action. 

![An example of a POST request to the sample project.](/docs/img/docs/using-the-planetscale-serverless-driver-for-js/an-example-of-a-post-request-to-the-sample-project.png)

If you check the terminal where the API was started, the response from the `execute` function is logged out for review.
