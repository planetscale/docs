## Overview

PlanetScale allows you to [create and manage passwords](/docs/concepts/connection-strings) for each branch of your database. PlanetScale passwords can be created with one of four roles:

- **Read-only** &mdash; Can query rows
- **Write-only** &mdash; Can modify rows
- **Read/Write** &mdash; Can query and modify rows
- **Admin** &mdash; All read/write permissions and can modify schema\*

\* _This does not apply to production branches, as we [do not allow direct DDL](/docs/learn/how-online-schema-change-tools-work) on production branches, even if your password has the `Admin` role._

## Create a password with custom role

1. Go to your database settings page.
2. Click "**Passwords**" > "**New password**".
3. Give it a name, select the role from the dropdown, select the branch, and click "**Generate password**".

Once a password is created, **its role cannot be changed**.

The access level available to these roles is shown in the table below.

| Role name  | Can create/edit schema | Can insert/update/delete rows | Can query rows |
| :--------- | :--------------------- | :---------------------------- | :------------- |
| Read-only  | ✖️                     | ✖️                            | ✔              |
| Write-only | ✖️                     | ✔                             | ✖️             |
| Read/write | ✖️                     | ✔                             | ✔              |
| Admin      | ✔                      | ✔                             | ✔              |

<InfoBlock type='note'>
  The default role for all passwords created by the **Connect** button is `Administrator`. Passwords with custom roles
  must be created from your database settings page.

## Troubleshooting

The following errors indicate that you do not have the permissions needed to perform an action. You must create a new password with a more privileged role to proceed.

**SELECT DENIED**

`Select command denied to user ‘planetscale-writer-only for table ‘customers’ (ACL check error) (CallerID: planetscale-writer-only)`

**INSERT DENIED**

`Insert command denied to user ‘planetscale-reader’ for table ‘customers’ (ACL check error) (CallerID: planetscale-reader)`

**DELETE DENIED**

`Delete command denied to user ‘planetscale-reader’ for table ‘customers’ (ACL check error) (CallerID: planetscale-reader)`

**DDL DENIED**

`DDL command denied to user ‘planetscale-writer' for table my-new-table’ (ACL check error) (CallerID: planetscale-writer)`
