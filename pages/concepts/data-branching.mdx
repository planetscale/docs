## Overview

The PlanetScale Data Branching&trade; feature (beta) allows you to create isolated copies of your database that include both the schema and data. This differs from our [regular branching feature](/docs/concepts/branching), which only includes the schema.

This feature is only available for organizations on the [`Team`](/pricing) plan.

2. Click on the "**Settings**" link in the header navigation bar.
3. Scroll to the option with the text "**Enable Data Branching**"
4. Enable this option and click "**Save database settings**".

## Create a development branch with data & schema from the Base branch

1. After enabling the Data Branching feature, navigate to the overview page of the database.
2. Clicking on "**New Branch**" should now offer an option to select "**Seed Data**".

- **None** &mdash; Creates a database branch with only the **schema** copied to the new branch.
- **From most recent backup** &mdash; Creates a database branch with both the **schema and data** from the latest backup of the Base branch.

### FAQ

1. **Can I pick which backup is used for the new branch?**

   PlanetScale picks the latest backup so that your new branch has the latest dataset to work with.

2. **Can I pick which tables are copied into the new branch?**

   PlanetScale seeds the new branch with **all the schema & data** from the base branch.
   We do not offer a way to filter out data or schema when creating a new branch.

3. **Is data in the new branch kept up to date with changes to the base branch?**

   PlanetScale does not provide data syncing between a production branch and a development branch.

4. **When I merge my deploy request, will any data changes be merged back to the base branch?**

   PlanetScale does not provide data syncing between a production branch and a development branch.

5. **Will enabling the Data Branching feature affect my billing?**

   PlanetScale will bill for the data inside of the new branch as part of your [overall database's plan](/docs/concepts/billing#planet-scale-plans). In this way, it is no different than if you filled the branch up manually.
