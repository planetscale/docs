## Overview

PlanetScale provides the ability to create, schedule, and restore backups for production and development database branches.

<InfoBlock type='note'>
  Daily backups of database branches are included free of charge for all databases. Our{' '}
  <a href='/docs/concepts/billing#planet-scale-plans'>Scaler and Team plans</a> include automated backups every 12
  hours.

## View backups

To view backups for all of your branches, go to your database backups page: `app.planetscale.com/<org>/<database>/backups`.

Once there, you'll find additional details about your backup history.

## Create manual backups

In addition to the daily default backups that PlanetScale schedules for your database branches, you can create additional **manual** backups.

To create a manual backup, follow the steps outlined below:

1. Go to your database backups page: `app.planetscale.com/<org>/<database>/backups`.

2. Click the **Create new backup** button.

This will bring up a pop-up modal that prompts you to pick a **branch** to backup, _name_ your backup, and select how long you wish to keep the backup.

<ImageBlock alt='Manual backup pop-up modal' src={createnewbackup} />

3. Click the **Create backup** button to finish the backup and close the pop-up modal.

4. Manual backups are not free and are denoted by the `$` icon next to their name in the list view on the backups page. 

<ImageBlock alt='Manual backups are shown with a $ sign' src={manualbackuprow} />

5. To see the cost associated with storage of a manual backup, click on the backup name. You will see the cost per month on the details page.

## Schedule backups

You can add additional **scheduled backups** for your branches, billed at $0.023 per GB per month.

1. Go to your database backups page: `app.planetscale.com/<org>/<database>/backups`.

2. Select the type of branch (`Production branches` | `Development branches` ) you'd like to be backed up by the new backup schedule.

<ImageBlock alt='Schedule backup pop-up modal' src={newbackupschedule} />

3. Click the **Add new schedule** button.

This will bring up a pop-up modal that prompts you to configure backup frequency, select how long you wish to keep the backup, and to _name_ your **schedule**.

<ImageBlock alt='Schedule backup pop-up modal' src={createnewbackupschedule} />

3. Click the **Save schedule** button to save your new scheduling configurations and to close the pop-up modal.

## Restore from a backup

To restore a backup to a new branch, click on the individual backup to see the option to restore them.

1. Go to your database backups page: `app.planetscale.com/<org>/<database>/backups`.

2. Select the backup you wish to restore.

3. Click the **Restore backup** button.

This will bring up a pop-up modal that prompts you to name your branch.

<ImageBlock alt='Restore backup pop-up modal' src={restore} />

4. Click the **Restore backup** button to finish restoring your backup and to close the pop-up modal.

5. To see all branches that are `restored` from a backup, head to the backup details and you'll see a list of those branches.
