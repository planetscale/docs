## Cloud accounts

PlanetScale is not responsible for the general configuration of services shared across the cloud organization in which the sub-account or project is provisioned. The customer is solely responsible for managing account access outside that granted to PlanetScale.

## Content restrictions

The data stored in PlanetScale Managed databases is contained entirely in the customer's AWS or GCP sub-account.

Customers are responsible for all content that is stored in the databases they have created.
