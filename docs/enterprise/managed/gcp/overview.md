## Overview

With PlanetScale Managed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a single-tenant deployment of PlanetScale in your GCP organization within an isolated project. In this configuration, you can use the same API, CLI, and web interface that PlanetScale offers, with the benefit of running entirely in a GCP project that you own and PlanetScale manages for you.

## Architecture

As you can see in the architecture diagram below, the PlanetScale data plane is deployed inside of a PlanetScale-controlled project in your GCP organization. Within the Vitess cluster orchestrated by Kubernetes, we use three GCP zones within a region to ensure high availability.

You can deploy PlanetScale Managed to any GCP region with at least three zones, including zones not supported by the PlanetScale self-serve product, and support for the required GCP services (including but not limited to Google Compute Engine (GCE), Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Cloud Storage, Persistent Disk, Cloud Key Management Service (Cloud KMS), Cloud Logging).

Backups, part of the data plane, are stored in Cloud Storage inside the same project. PlanetScale Managed uses isolated GCE instances as part of the deployment.

PlanetScale will not have access to any other projects or your organization level settings. Outside of your GCP organization, we run the PlanetScale control plane, which includes the PlanetScale API and web application, including the dashboard you see at `app.planetscale.com`.

## Security and compliance

PlanetScale Managed is an excellent option for organizations with specific security and compliance requirements.

You own the GCP organization and project that PlanetScale is deployed within in an isolated architecture. This differs from when your PlanetScale database is deployed within our GCP organizations.

Along with System and Organization Controls (SOC) 2 Type 2 and PlanetScale [security and compliance](/docs/concepts/security) practices that PlanetScale has been issued and follows, we can also sign BAAs for [HIPAA compliance](/blog/planetscale-and-hipaa) on PlanetScale Managed.

### GCP Private Service Connect

By default, all connections are encrypted, but public. Optionally, you also have the option to use private database connectivity through [GCP Private Service Connect](/docs/enterprise/managed/gcp/private-service-connect), which is only available on single-tenancy deployment options, including PlanetScale Managed.
