## Overview

PlanetScale is removing our Hobby tier. [Please read our blog post here to learn more](/blog/planetscale-forever).

All existing Hobby tier databases will need to upgrade their database to a paid plan by April 8, 2024. Databases which are not upgraded by April 8th will be shutdown and no longer accessible. Data will not be deleted, but a paid plan will be required to access data after April 8th.

## What is happening to the Hobby tier?

PlanetScale has made the decision to stop offering our Hobby tier.

On March 6th, it will no longer be possible to create new Hobby tier databases. Databases which are not upgraded by April 8th will be shutdown and no longer accessible. Data will not be deleted, but a paid plan will be required to access data after April 8th.

## How do I stop my database from going offline?

To prevent your database from going offline on April 8th, you need to upgrade to a paid plan.

## Will PlanetScale delete my data?

No! PlanetScale's [database sleeping](/docs/concepts/database-sleeping) makes a backup copy of your data before shutting a database down and safely archives it. If you would like to access this data in the future, you will need to upgrade your database to a paid plan.

## How do I migrate off of PlanetScale?

First, export the data from your branch using the [PlanetScale CLI](/docs/concepts/planetscale-environment-setup):

```bash
pscale db dump <DATABASE_NAME> <BRANCH_NAME>
```

This may take several minutes, depending on the amount of data in the branch. The dump of your data will be in a folder in your working directory. For example:

```bash
pscale database dump test main
```

You'll see a message like this:

```
Starting to dump all tables from database test to folder /Users/nick/pscale_dump_test_main_20240305_144231
Dumping is finished! (elapsed time: 3.886106333s)
```

Inside of the `pscale_dump_test_main_20240305_144231` folder, there is a `test.test-schema.sql` file which contains the schema for the database, as well as one or more files with names like `test.test.00001.sql` which contain the data.

PlanetScale's CLI uses a format compatible with [`https://github.com/mydumper/mydumper`](https://github.com/mydumper/mydumper), which can be used to load the data into another instance of MySQL. Using a MySQL instance hosted on DigitalOcean as an example:

```bash
cat db.ini
[myloader]
host = db-mysql-sfo3-5233-do-user-137498-0.b.db.ondigitalocean.com
user = doadmin
password = <REDACTED>
database = defaultdb
port = 25060
```

Then, we can run `go-mydumper` to load data into the other MySQL instance:

```bash
myloader --defaults-file db.ini --directory pscale_dump_test_main_20240305_144231/
```

If you get an error that looks like:

```sql
Unknown column 'nick2' in 'field list'
```

Ensure that your `SQL_MODE` does not contain `ANSI_QUOTES`.

Once this is done, your data should be loaded in your other MySQL database.

If you run into any issues, please don't hesitate to reach out to `support@planetscale.com` or submit a ticket at [`https://support.planetscale.com`](https://support.planetscale.com).

## How do I get my data after April 8th?

To connect to your data and access it after April 8th, you will need to upgrade to a paid plan, such as Scaler Pro. You will not be billed until it is fully awake.

We do not want to hold your data hostage. If your database has been slept and you don't want to upgrade to a paid plan or cannot afford it, please write into `support@planetscale.com`. We will happily bring your database back online for 24 hours so that you can export your data using the [migration path](#how-do-i-migrate-off-of-planetscale) we have outlined in this document.

## I can't migrate in time, help!

If this causes you or your business problems, please don't hesitate to reach out to `support@planetscale.com` or submit a ticket at [`https://support.planetscale.com`](https://support.planetscale.com). We are happy
to work with you to minimize the disruption that this change causes.
