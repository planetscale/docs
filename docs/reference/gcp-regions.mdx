We currently support some Google Cloud Provider regions for creating databases and branches. GCP support is in beta, so there are some limitations, which will be covered in this document.

## Available GCP regions

- (Beta) GCP North America (Council Bluffs, Iowa) &mdash; `gcp-us-central1`

## GCP beta limitations

As GCP region support is currently in beta, there are some limitations to its use.

### Portals

You currently cannot create [read-only regions](/docs/concepts/read-only-regions) using GCP regions. In addition, if your production database branch is using a GCP region, you cannot spin up a read-only replica using an AWS region.

### Using AWS and GCP regions

If you have a database with branches in both AWS and GCP regions, you cannot restore backups between those AWS and GCP regions using our [backup tool](/docs/concepts/back-up-and-restore). It is, however, possible to manually import a backup using a MySQL dump.
