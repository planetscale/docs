## Overview

Now that you have an account and database set up, we can explore one of the key features of PlanetScale: branching.

This guide continues from the [previous entry](/docs/onboarding/create-a-database) describing how to create a database. If you do not have a database created, follow the steps in that guide before proceeding
{% /callout %}

## What are branches?

Branches are copies of your database schema that live in a completely separate environment from each other. Making changes in one branch does not affect other branches until you merge them, just like you manage code branches in your projects.

There are currently two types of branches in PlanetScale:

- Production branches
- Non-production branches

### Production branches

Production branches should be used for the production version of your application. There are certain measures in place on production branches to protect your production data:

- Console access is disabled by default.
- Production branches include at least one read-only replica internally to automatically protect your database against outages.
- Scheduled backups are enabled automatically.

#### Safe migrations

Production branches also support [safe migrations](/docs/concepts/safe-migrations). When safe migrations is enabled, the branch is affected in the following ways:

- The branch will support the PlanetScale non-blocking schema change workflow.
- Direct DDL is disabled to prevent accidental schema changes. You would instead apply schema changes using Deploy requests (covered later in this guide).

As a best practice, it is recommended that you enable safe migrations on your production branches. The remainder of theses guides will assume it is enabled.

### Non-production branches

Your database can have one or more non-production branches, depending on your plan. Non-production branches are used for making changes or experimenting with your database structure. These branches do not have the same protective restrictions or resiliency as production branches.

### Deploy requests

Deploy requests are how changes from development branches are merged into production branches with safe migrations enabled. They are similar to pull requests in your code repositories, but for databases. When a new Deploy request is created, you can view the changes, comment on them, and collaborate with your team just like you would a PR.

## Typical branching strategy

![The PlanetScale workflow.](/img/planetscale-workflow.png)

Most applications have at least two environments, a production environment where active users work with the application, and a development environment where developers extend the application and test changes. PlanetScale is built with this in mind, which is why branching is such a fundamental feature.

A typical strategy with branching would go something like this:

- The PlanetScale database has two branches: `main` and `dev`.
- A developer decides to extend a form in the application and needs to add a new field. They create a branch in the code to manage their changes.
- Because this is a new data field, a new column must be added to the corresponding table in PlanetScale. The developer adds this column to the `dev` branch of the PlanetScale database.
- After the new field has been added to the code, the developer creates a pull request to merge the code branches, and a **Deploy request** in PlanetScale to merge the database changes.
- The PlanetScale deploy request is merged first to ensure that the column exists in the database before the application code starts writing to it. Once live, the application code pull request is merged in. With this branching workflow, the schema changes are safely applied to the `main` branch of the database without any table locking occurring and zero downtime to the users of the application.

## Branching in action

Now that you understand why branches are such an important feature in PlanetScale, let’s see how to use them.
We're going to enable safe migrations on the default `main` production branch, create a new development branch, add a new column, create a deploy request, and deploy it to production.

### Enable safe migrations on `main`

Start by navigating to the `beam-demo` database, click the **"cog"** within the infrastructure card.

![The Overview tab of the database.](/assets/docs/onboarding/branching-and-deploy-requests/cog-3.png)

In the modal that appears, toggle the option labeled **"Enable safe migrations"** and click **"Save"**.

![The safe migrations modal.](/assets/docs/onboarding/branching-and-deploy-requests/prod-branch-options-modal.png)

The card will reflect the safe migrations status on that branch as well add an option to create a new branch.

![The production branch UI card with safe migrations enabled.](/assets/docs/onboarding/branching-and-deploy-requests/promoted-2.png?v2)

### Create a dev branch

Back in the database **"Overview"** tab, click the **"Create new branch"** button to create a new branch.

![The production branch UI card with the Create new branch button highlighted.](/assets/docs/onboarding/branching-and-deploy-requests/new-branch-2.png?v2)

In the **New branch** modal, you’ll see options to name the branch, select the base, and even change the region for this branch. Name the branch `dev` and click **"Create branch"**.

![The New branch modal.](/assets/docs/onboarding/branching-and-deploy-requests/the-new-branch-modal.png)

The branch takes a few minutes to initialize. Wait for this process to complete before proceeding. Once the branch is ready to go, the page will automatically update to allow you to create deploy requests directly from the **"Overview"** tab.

### Make a schema change

Now that the branch is initialized, let’s update the schema of our `Post` table and add a `summary` column. Click the **"Console"** tab, select the `dev` branch, and click "**Connect**".

![Connect to the console.](/assets/docs/onboarding/branching-and-deploy-requests/console-2.png?v2)

Run the following script to update the schema, followed by a `DESCRIBE` statement to view the changes to that table.

```sql
ALTER TABLE Post ADD summary VARCHAR(1024);
DESCRIBE Post;
```

![The console with the output of the ALTER command.](/assets/docs/onboarding/branching-and-deploy-requests/the-console-with-the-output-of-the-alter-command.png)

Before we merge these changes, let's double-check the `main` branch of the database and compare the structure of the same table. Run the following command in `main`'s console to see the structure of the `Post` table.

```sql
DESCRIBE Post;
```

![The console of the main branch with the output of the DESCRIBE command.](/assets/docs/onboarding/branching-and-deploy-requests/the-console-of-the-main-branch-with-the-output-of-the-describe-command.png)

Notice how `summary` is missing. This is because we made the change on the `dev` branch and haven’t merged the changes into `main`. Let’s fix that now.

### Create a deploy request

On the **"Branches"** tab, you can now create a deploy request. Select the branch from which the changes will be migrated, enter an optional comment, , on the right side you will see the button **"Create deploy request"**, click on it.

The creation process will take a couple of minutes, and a notification will appear at the button when the deploy request is finished. 


![The Overview tab of the dev branch.](/assets/docs/onboarding/branching-and-deploy-requests/the-overview-tab-of-the-dev-branch.png)

PlanetScale will automatically check to see if your changes can be deployed by comparing the schemas between the `dev` and `main` branches. Once that process is completed, you’ll get the option to deploy the changes or close the deploy request. Unlike pull requests, you can only have one active deploy request on a branch at any given time. If you needed to create another deploy request, you’d have to close the previous one out.

There is also the option to auto-apply your changes after PlanetScale has finished staging them. This option is selected by default. If it is disabled, PlanetScale will stage your changes and wait for you to manually apply them before making them live, which can be helpful under certain circumstances.

Once you are done exploring, click the **"Deploy changes"** button on the summary tab.

![The Summary tab of the deploy request.](/assets/docs/onboarding/branching-and-deploy-requests/the-summary-tab-of-the-deploy-request.png)

Once the changes are deployed, the status of the deployment will be displayed, along with how long the deployment took and who initiated it.

![The deploy request view after changes have been deployed.](/assets/docs/onboarding/branching-and-deploy-requests/the-deploy-request-view-after-changes-have-been-deployed.png)

Head back to the console of the `main` branch and run the `DESCRIBE` command again. Notice how the `main` branch now has the `summary` column that was added to `dev` earlier in the guide.

```sql
DESCRIBE Post;
```

You should have a good understanding of the core concepts of PlanetScale at this point. In the next guide, we’ll cover how you can connect to your PlanetScale database using the language or client of your choice.
