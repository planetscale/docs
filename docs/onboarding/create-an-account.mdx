## Overview

In this guide, we’ll begin your journey into PlanetScale by creating an account and exploring the PlanetScale dashboard.

## Create an account

Creating a PlanetScale account is straightforward. Navigate to the [sign up page](https://auth.planetscale.com/sign-up) and provide an email address and password. Accept the Terms of Service and click **"Sign up"**.

Once you complete the form, you’ll be redirected to a page stating your email address needs to be verified.
