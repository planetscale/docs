## Overview

This guide will cover how to use the provided Node.js sample application using the PlanetScale serverless driver for JavaScript. Before following this guide, make sure you've [enabled the feature](/docs/tutorials/planetscale-serverless-driver) and created a password to use with the driver.

This guide will be using VS Code as the IDE, but you may use your preferred IDE.

## Use the sample repository

We offer a sample repository that can be used as an educational resource. It is an Express API that can be run locally with sample `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements mapped to the proper API endpoints.

To follow along, you’ll need the following:

- A PlanetScale account, as well as knowing how to create a database.
- The PlanetScale CLI is installed on your computer, which will be used to seed data.

Start by creating a database in PlanetScale by clicking **"New database"** > **"Create new database"**.

<ImageBlock alt='How to create a new database.' src={img0} />

Name the database `travel_db`. Click **"Create database"**.

<ImageBlock alt='The New database modal.' src={img1} />

Wait for the database to finish initializing before moving on.

<ImageBlock alt='The travel_db initializing.' src={img2} />

Enable the **PlanetScale serverless driver for JavaScript** feature by clicking on **"Settings"** > **"Beta features"**, then clicking **"Enroll"** in the PlanetScale serverless driver for JavaScript section.

<ImageBlock alt='Enable PlanetScale serverless driver for JavaScript for travel_db.' src={img3} />

Generate a set of credentials by clicking the **"Connect"** button.

<ImageBlock alt='The Connect button in the PlanetScale dashboard.' src={img4} />

Select **"@planetscale/database"** from the options in the **"Connect with"** dropdown. Copy the text from the **".env"** tab as we'll be putting this in the project after it's pulled down from GitHub.

<ImageBlock alt='The Connect modal.' src={img5} />

On your workstation, open a terminal and clone the repository to your computer by running the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/planetscale/database-js-starter
```

Navigate to the `scripts` folder and run the `seed_database.sh` script to populate a small database simulating a travel agency.

```bash
cd database-js-starter/scripts
./seed-database.sh
```

If you are using Windows, run this command through the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/)

</InfoBlock>

Create a new file file named `.env` in the root of the project and paste in the sample provided from PlanetScale.

<ImageBlock alt='The .env example.' src={img6} />

To run the project, run the following commands from the root of the project.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

If the project is running properly, you should receive a message stating that the API is running.

<ImageBlock alt='The terminal running the sample project.' src={img7} />

The `tests.http` file is designed to work with the [VS Code Rest Client plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client), but can be used as a reference when testing with the tool of your choosing. If you are using the plugin, you may click the **"Send request"** button that appears above each request to see the API in action.

<ImageBlock alt='An example of a POST request to the sample project.' src={img8} />

If you check the terminal where the API was started, the response from the `execute` function is logged out for review.
